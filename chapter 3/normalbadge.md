## THE NORMALITY BADGE
---

There’s a servant here that will act as an Audino breeder, she’ll give you 5 Exp. Candy M every time you win. Head north and there’s another servant that will give you some advice on how to fight Marianette.

MarianetteBattle

Before you do anything, read the effects of the Blessed Field. You cannot rely on ghost type Pokémon for this fight no matter how much you want to, as normal type attacks hit them AND dark types with super effective damage. Marianette’s Pokémon thrive on this field, with almost all of them having Multipulse, a move that will give coverage and is boosted x1.3. Focus on the secondary types of most of the Pokémon, and remember that your level cap is 30, so you can brute force the fight if you feel you need to. The first time Chatot comes out it’s most likely going to be Zorua, so you can hit it with a normal type move yourself to get it with super effective damage. Don’t let the actual Chatot set up too much either or it’ll sweep through your team.

On the bright side, if you have a dragon type like Aevian Swadloon (which you can evolve with rare candies at level 32) its Dragon Claw is also boosted on the field. Read through the field and plan around it, and listen to the Servant that gave you advice! She’s got some good info.

Once you win, you’ll get the… *Normality Badge*? Okay. Watch the following cutscenes, then exit Venam’s house to get *TM42 - Facade* and another Team Xen cutscene! Accept the fast travel to East Gearen to begin the next chapter.
