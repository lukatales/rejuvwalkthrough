## BREAKING NEWS
---

Eldest will give you *2 Super Potions* once you wake up. Accept Aelita’s fast travel. There’s one thing we can do in Sheridan but I’ll be postponing it for when we come back with a higher level cap.

When you’re at Route 2, don’t take the train just yet. Go to the Kecleon Bazaar to buy yourself a *Mirror Lure* for $2000. This item is great for shiny hunting Pokémon, just put the Pokémon you want to hunt (making sure it’s available in the location you’re in) and put the lure on it, that way it’s the only Pokémon that will show up! It works great in tandem with the Magnetic Lure, which will help you find the Pokémon you’re trying to hunt in the first place.

Let’s go to East Gearen! Aelita will be impressed with you if you decided to help Karrina in Amethyst cave. (Aelita +2)

There’s a trio of shop owners to the left where you can stock up on supplies.

Make sure to buy an Oran Berry if you don’t have one in your bag and save it for later.

Go to the Abandoned Sewers entrance and talk to Amanda.

If you’re lucky then East Gearen might be raining when you fight Amanda, which means a lot of Sunny Day strategies might be disrupted with it turning to the Rainbow Field instead. Either way, the fight won’t be hard for a full team. Most of her Pokémon, with the exception of Miltank and boosted Weepinbell are quite slow, which means you can take your time buffing yourself or debuffing them. Miltank might be a pain with Milk Drink, but if you’ve got Quick Attack you should be able to beat it before long since it’s boosted on the City Field.

Amanda will give you *HM01 - Cut* when you beat her!

Enter the sewers and go all the way up through the glowing door.

Venam is back!

**Friendship Value Choices**
 - You’re Lucha? (Venam +1)
 - Venam’s friend? (Venam +2)
 - Have we met? (Neutral)

Go to the right and through the hidden entrance next to the vines to find Password #3: 8187. Then, go to the left and grab the weird key and interact with the gate to open it.

The patches of grass here have some new Pokémon for us.

| LAND              | %   | LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   |
|:------------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|
| **Alolan Meowth** | 32% | **Plusle**    | 15% | **Porygon**   | 4% |
| **Hoppip**        | 15% | **Minun**     | 14%  |    |  |
| **Skiploom**      | 10% | Girafarig     | 10%  |    |  |

There’s another entrance in the ledge that will let you go around and unlock the key from the inside. Talk to Venam at the door to have her point out the open window and enter the mansion. There’s no turning back now.

Follow the girl out of the room and upstairs. Go upstairs again and go to the room on the left to talk to her. Marianette is gonna join your party! We’re going to be spending a lot of time with her, so we’ll make sure to have as much fun as we can in this terrible place. Talk to her in every new room/area you enter, it’ll give you more friendship with her and you’ll find out some neat information.

Leave the room and talk to the maids to get access to Indriad’s study.

If you enter the room on the right you can read some books and talk with Marianette.

Go down the left set of stairs and talk to the maid sitting on the couch, she’s going to give you an extra trial for a neat reward. 

Let’s go left first through the room with the locked storage, all the way out to the courtyard. There’s a maze coming up where you’re going to be chased by a Dusknoir, so turn off speed up if you have it on. You’ll want to follow the “doors” next to red ivy to the end, and you can’t be caught by the Dusknoir or you’ll be sent back to the beginning. If you’re getting stuck toward the top because a Dusknoir keeps cutting you off, you can actually go around one of the Dusknoir spawn points. You can also quick save with ‘D’! There’s some points in the maze where Dusknoir gets caught on the edges so you can take a breather.

Don’t worry about the extra goodies in the maze, we’ll be able to come back for it when the Dusknoir isn’t there to send us into a panic. You and Marianette got this!

 - Yeah, I am. (Marianette -1)
 - It was nothing… (Marianette +2)
 - You flatter me… (Marianette +1)
 - Say it again. (Marianette -3)

DusknoirBoss

You’ve got Marianette with you, so even if this seems hard you have a great deal of backup. Just watch out for the shield break and try to whittle down its defensive bulk if you can since Dusknoir isn’t exactly fast. Marianette will also help out with her Intimidate Stantler so it doesn’t get too powerful.

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - It was cool. (Neutral)
 - Calm down. (Marianette -3)
 - You were a great help! (Marianette +3)

Go down the stairs and interact with the flame to free Luca!

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - You’re growing. (Marianette +2)
 - Yeah, you are. (Marianette -2)
 - You can change that! (Marianette +3)

Let’s go and loot the maze. Make sure you find the *Sitrus Berry*, *Elixir*, *PP Up*, *Super Potion* (it has two), *2 Exp Candy Ms* (in the same spot), and a *Normal Gem*. There’s also a servant you need to fight in the maze and Password #1: 7896.

Go back inside the manor and enter the dining room on the right. Talk to Marianette until you get the option to give her an Oran Berry, she deserves it! (Marianette +7)

Keep going right until you’re outside. There’s another hidden password here on the hedge: Password #2: 3135. Keep going up to start the second trial. Hidden behind a tree, near the red tree on the left, is another servant you need to battle.

Head up to start the trial. You want to put each of the statues on the colored tiles at the same time: 
 1. Right, Up, Right, Right, Right, Left, Left, Up
 2. Down, Right, Left, Up, Up, Up, Left, Right
 3. Right, Up, Left, Left, Left, Down, Down, Right, Right, Up, Up, Right, Up

Interact the glowing flame and free Lenny.

 - To instill fear. (Marianette +2)
 - Who knows? (Marianette -1)
 - It’s a fun hobby! (Marianette -3)

Go back and enter the manor again and then exit out the front door. Don’t go down to the third trial yet, instead keep going down to find a servant near the flowers you need to battle to complete your extra trial. Go back inside the manor and talk to the servant on the couch and have her open all the doors. 

Go to the left and enter the storage room. Grab the *Elixir*, *Ability Capsule*, *Super Potion*, *Full Heal*, and *Reverse Candy*. Interact with the weapons if you’d like. Talk to Marianette and have her investigate the boxes to battle a **Bronzor**.

Head back to the courtyard and take the stairs under the Absol statue. Turn off speed up, it’s time for the third trial.

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - You did well. (Marianette +4)
 - You cut it kinda close… (Marianette -2)

Follow Marianette into the next room. If you’ve become close friends with Marianette and her friendship value is 5 or higher she’ll ask you to forgive her.

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - It’s okay Marianette. (Marianette +8)
 - I don’t know… (Marianette -12)

It’s almost time for the final fight, but let’s do a couple of things first.

Exit the courtyard and the sewers to pick up the package Aelita left for us with *3 Super Potions*, *4 Exp. Candy M*, *2 Exp. Candy S*, *2 Chesto Berries*, a *Cheri Berry*, and some *Protective Pads*!

Go back to the manor and go to the room where Marianette freed you. Enter the door at the top and go up, you’re gonna have to input the three passwords we found around the manor in order: 7896, 3135, and 8187. Enter the room and meet Anju, she’ll have some questions for you. Tell her the world is fine, Sheridan is fine, but Hiyoshi is destroyed. She’ll give you *Anju’s Pendant* for being honest with her.

It’s time to face the music. Enter the double doors behind the servant sitting on the couch.
