## GEAREN LAB
---
Walk directly north. Before entering the building pick up the hidden *Ice Heal* in the rock to the right.

Enter the lab and watch a cutscene. The woman to the left of Nurse Joy will explain more things about Rejuvenation's mechanics if you want clarification. The counter on the lower left of the first floor serves as out first PokéMart.

{: .text-blue-000}
Gearen Lab Mart

| ITEM           | PRICE  |
|:---------------|:-------|
| *Potion*       | $300   |
| *Antidote*     | $100   |
| *Repel*        | $350   |
| *Poké Ball*    | $200   |

You start with $3000. Pick up some Poké Balls if you like. Repels are worthless in this game thanks to an item we'll get very soon, so I recommend never paying for any as well as selling any that you come across.

Head through the blue door in the top left, narrowly avoid getting run over, and meet this region's professor. You’ll be taken to a room where you can pick one of 24 starters organized by type and the generation they were introduced in. If you’d like, interact with the rainbow machine on the right side to get a randomly chosen starter.

You can quick save with ‘D’ in front of the starter you’d like and press ‘F12’ to soft reset for natures, shininess, and abilities. In this game all Pokémon can be shiny and have a chance to have their hidden ability. The base shiny rate is a little over 1%, and you can check for shininess in the nickname screen.

For those that’d like a strong starter to make the game a bit easier, Speed Boost Torchic is easily the most recommended option, followed by Libero Scorbunny and Protean Froakie. The first gym specializes in poison types, so grass types might have more of a difficult time in there, but all starters are viable in one way or another, so pick whatever you’d like! 

Once you’ve picked out your starter, talk to Amanda and get ready for a battle! You can win or lose this one.

{: .text-blue-000}
Amanda Battle

You can press the ‘S’ key to check the stat changes of all the Pokémon on the field, as well as the field effect, weather, screens, and other nifty information. Amanda will give you 5 Poké Balls to get started after the battle.

Go back down to talk to Professor Jenner where you’ll fight Ren. You can win or lose this one too!

{: .text-blue-000}
Ren Battle

After battling, Jenner will ask you to check in on his daughter Melia on Route 1. For your trouble you get a *Pokédex* and a *Cybernav*! The Pokédex is self explanatory, but there’s a few features on the Cybernav that are very helpful to us. You can check where you are with the “Map” and change what music you’re listening to with the “Jukebox” apps. “Achievements” allows you to track your progress on all the achievements listed, and help you figure out what you need to do to complete them. “Spice Scent” essentially replaces the need for repels forever, as it changes the encounter rate. Don’t want to run back and forth waiting for an encounter? Set it to 9999 and you’ll be running into a Pokémon on every tile! Or you can set it to 0 and never run into any Pokémon at all! 

The “Move Tutor” app won’t become useful to us until later, but essentially any time you encounter a Move Tutor NPC out in the world and buy access to one of their moves you’ll have permanent access to it in this app. For example, if I spend 3 Red Shards to teach Explosion to one Pokémon in a far away city I won’t have to find that NPC again or spend those red shards ever again since I can access that move through this app and teach it to whoever else can learn it. Neat, huh?

Head back downstairs. There’s an EV training room on the far right, but none of the rooms are available to us right now. 

There are two NPCs that have side quests available to us in the Lab, evident by the exclamation marks floating above their heads. One is in the downstairs lobby area next to Nurse Joy, and the other is up the stairs in the Gearen Archive room, but I'll be covering both of them later. For now, just know that most sidequests can be tracked in the "Quest" section of the Menu. It’ll provide you with a small summary of each quest, other useful information like quest expiration date, and the location you have to go to next to continue the quest.

Finally, let’s exit the lab and explore what the city has to offer!

This guide won't be covering minor NPC trainers, but from this point forward you'll start to see field effects in battle. For more information on what field effect does you can visit the Field_Effect_Manual in your Rejuvenation folder, or visit the Field Effect Manual page on this guide. I'll also be covering relevant effects and strategies for major battles.

The patches of grass around East Gearen have opened so consider catching some Pokémon!

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City (Left)

| GRASS: MORN        | %   | GRASS: DAY      | %   | GRASS: NIGHT        | %   |
|:-------------------|:----|:----------------|:----|:--------------------|:----|
| **Wurmple**        | 27% | **Wurmple**     | 27% | **Wurmple**         | 27% |
| **Alolan Rattata** | 25% | **Bidoof**      | 25% | **Alolan Rattata**  | 25% |
| **Patrat**         | 15% | **Patrat**      | 15% | **Poochyena**       | 15% |
| **Pidgey**         | 15% | **Pidove**      | 15% | **Hoothoot**        | 15% |
| **Bellsprout**     | 12% | **Bellsprout**  | 12% | **Oddish**          | 12% |
| **Sunkern**        | 6%  | **Sunkern**     | 6%  | **Chingling**       | 6%  |

Wurmple evolving into Dustox is good for the first gym, as well as Chingling and Hoothoot. Alolan Rattata is also a certified beast in early game with the boosts it gets in City Field, as well as its significant speed.

There’s a *Gourmet Treat* in a flowery tile in the grass patch below the lab, to the left of the round bush. These treats are used to encounter some event Pokémon, so make sure to always have a few on hand!

Below that patch of grass there's a rock with a hidden *Poké Ball* in it. If you go to the right and down and talk to the nerd, he’ll give you a *Reverse Candy*. Below him and to the right there’s a rock with a *Potion*, and to the right there’s another rock with a *Green Shard*.  Go north of the charmer that battles you and in the patch of lighter colored grass to the right of the girl there's a hidden *Oran Berry*.

Head back down toward Oceana Pier. There’s a **Nidoran M** looking for food and you can feed it a Gourmet Treat for a battle.

The garden to the south is now open, and you’ll be able to battle the **Fletchling** there if you interact with them. There’s an *X Accuracy* to the right of  the middle bottom blue and white flower tile, and a *Sweet Heart* in the other flower patch of grass in the bottom right corner.

Enter the building on the west side labeled “Ferry Terminal.” Talk to the blonde guy and exit the building to watch the Buizel run by. This starts a quest for later.

Back in East Gearen, let’s start going through all the buildings. To the left of the lab is the Velvet Building. Go up the elevator to the first floor and talk to the woman in the middle. Choose left and she’ll give you a *Mineral Ball*, choose right and you’ll get a *Steam Ball*. Pick up the *Great Ball* in the lower left corner and go to the second floor where you’ll be able to battle a **Pachirisu** if you give it a Gourmet Treat at nighttime and grab a *Potion*. On the third floor there’s an *Exp. Candy XS*. Exit the building.

In the house next door there's a repel that you can sell for some quick cash because of the lovely Spice Scent app.

Exit and go to the right, all the way to where you fought that charmer and go up past the bridge. Going further up will find you a **Nidoran F** that will run away from you and go to one of the following locations. It will give you a hint on which direction it’s heading when it runs away:
 - To the right of the Route 1 train station
 - In front of the Help Plaza
 - To the left of the tree where you battled that Charmer
 - To the right of the Purple Building where you can battle it

In this area pick up the hidden *Gourmet Treat* on the rightmost tile of the three shipping crates and the hidden *Super Repel* in the little crevice on the building's wall tile.

Go to the Emerald Building and talk to the lady in the green dress, then beat the guy in front of the elevator to be able to use it. The second floor will have a *Red Shard* in the bottom left corner. Talking to the red-haired girl will grant you a *Full Heal* and talking to the old woman will grant you a *Super Repel*.. Enter the third floor at night time for the chance to battle a level 5 **Shuppet**. Ghost Pokémon that can learn Curse, and any Pokémon that can learn Destiny Bond for that matter, are incredibly valuable to help with some of the harder boss fights in the game, so consider catching it.

Exit and go further left to find a Help Plaza. This building acts as a hub for most of the sidequests in the game. As stated before, you can find sidequests both here and in the overworld - and some side quests won’t be connected to a Help Plaza at all, so be vigilant in your travels. I’ll be covering all of the sidequests found here in 
[Post-Gym Quests](https://lukatales.github.io/rejuvwalkthrough/chapter%201/postpoisonbadge.html)

Next to the plaza you’ll find the library where you can enter for $300, but there’s really no need to just yet. Instead, take the stairs and talk to the person on the far right of the room. This is Zumi and she’ll give us a quest to find and catch a Dedenne, a task we’ll keep note of for later.

On the bridge next to this building you’ll be blocked by a thug who will force you to cough up $300 dollars or battle him to get passed. He uses 3 12-13 level Pokémon, so only battle him if you’re ready.

Since this is your first real “hurdle,” now’s a good time to talk about what happens after you white out after losing a battle. You’ll be transported to a pastel paradise where your Pokémon will be healed. There’s a PC to swap out your team and on the table there will be some Exp. Candies that differ in size depending on where you’re at in the game. Stepping on the warp pad at the bottom teleports you back to the last Pokémon Center/safe place you went to. It’s a nice hub to rethink strategies and take a breather after losing.

Beating the thug in a battle will grant you (+1 Karma), a variable used to track your good deeds around Aevium.

Hidden in the rock in the patch of grass is a *Super Potion* and there's a hidden *Yellow Shard* on the top tile of the dumpster before the little girl. There’s also a *Red Shard* to the right of the guard blocking the station entrance in one of the flower patches of grass.

Head all the way back toward the right to enter the next section of East Gearen City. We’re not even close to being done!

{: .text-blue-000}
## EAST GEAREN CITY (RIGHT)

Some more patches of grass here, this time with a slightly different set of Pokémon.

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City (Right)

| GRASS: MORN    | %   | GRASS: DAY     | %   | GRASS: NIGHT     | %   |
|:---------------|:----|:---------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|
| **Paras**      | 29% | **Paras**      | 29% | **Jigglypuff**   | 29% |
| Alolan Rattata | 25% | Bidoof         | 25% | Alolan Rattata   | 25% |
| Patrat         | 17% | Patrat         | 17% | Poochyena        | 17% |
| **Pidgey**     | 15% | Pidove         | 15% | Hoothoot         | 15% |
| **Klink**      | 4%  | **Bellsprout** | 4%  | **Klink**        | 4%  |

Catch a female Jigglypuff to breed later.

There’s a few more shops to look through! First off, talk to the black belt in front of the Lilligant sign. He’s selling *Poké Balls* for $400 a pop which is definitely a rip off. However, if you buy four he’ll accidently give you a **Voltorb**!

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City Mart

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Burn Heal*      | $250   |
| *Potion*         | $300   |
| *Gourmet Treat*  | $1500  |
| *Repel*          | $350   |
| *Reverse Candy*  | $50    |

Here’s a good spot to sell all those repels you don’t need anymore. You can also sell any vitamins or wings since EV training items are easier to come by. Reverse Candies don’t seem incredibly useful until you realize that you can use Rare Candies to over level yourself past the hard cap to evolve or learn a move, then use the Reverse Candy to get yourself back down to the cap so your Pokémon doesn’t become truant. I recommend buying a couple of Gourmet Treats if you’re already out as well, since they’re always good to have on hand.

Next to the mart there’s a guy next to a truck. He’s going to be how we fast travel around Floria Island, but we can’t do anything with him right now.

Enter the Petal Salon. They sell haircuts on the top floor but you can’t get those until you finish a quest. For now just enjoy the berries sold on the first floor

{: .text-blue-000}
Berry Emporium

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Oran Berry*     | $200   |
| *Pecha Berry*    | $300   |

Consider getting a few of each for the early game.

The building above sells specialty Poké Balls.

{: .text-blue-000}
Poké Ball Boutique

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Heavy Ball*     | $200   |
| *Moon Ball*      | $300   |

The rock to the right of the boutique that’s sitting in a patch of grass holds a hidden *Potion*. Go up and through the fence to get a *Super Repel* hidden in the rock to the right, as well as the *Super Potion* laying there to the left. There’s also a hidden *Resist Wing* in the rock behind the Super Potion.

To the left of the berry filled backyard there’s an alleyway with new Pokémon.

{: .text-blue-000}
Gearen Alleyway

| LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   |
|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|
| **Purrloin**  | 35% | **Drowzee**   | 32% | **Rattata**   | 20% |
| Pidgey        | 10% | Klink         | 4% |    |  |

There’s a *Red Shard* hidden on the floor 3 tiles four tiles right and two tiles up from the trainer, a *Blue Shard* in the rock along the bottom, and a *Rare Candy* in the rock at the top.

Exit the alleyway, go down and then all the way to the right until you hit the ocean. You’ll see a **Buizel** staring sadly off into the ocean. Interact with it and win the battle against its old trainer to get it to join your team!

Go up but don’t pass the hedges yet. Pick up the hidden *Paralyze Heal* on the left fence before entering the area. There’s an *Iron* in the upper left corner and a *Green Shard* in the blue and white flower tile  right before the maze entrance. In the maze you’ll find an *Antidote* in the top right, a hidden *Revive* in the bottom right (in a blue and white flower tile), a hidden *Repel* in the rock in the middle, and a hidden *Red Shard* next to *TM83 - Infestation*!

Enter the Crisola Hotel.

{: .text-blue-000}
### Chrisola Hotel
---

Watch a short cutscene where you almost get run over by a Ms. Blakeory. Oops! (Saki +1)

After regaining control you can talk to the black belt in the bottom right corner for a free *Super Potion*. Go to the right hallway and grab *TM126 - Whirlpool* in the first open room you see. Circle around to the left and enter the middle room. Stand on the tile 1 down and 1 to the right of the upper left plant and hit the interact button when facing the bed to get $1500!

Go back to the lobby and go to the elevator to head to the Casino/AP Center. Talk to the girl with red hair to get her to flush her Coin Case down the toilet so we can pick it up later.

If you’ve been paying attention to the achievement pop ups you’ve noticed that you’ve been earning something called “AP,” or Achievement Points. Talk to the Lass next to the counter on the right to receive an Achievement Card that will help you check out how many AP you have anywhere you go. AP points are used to buy things from this counter like HM items that allow you to use HM moves without wasting a moveslot, cards to allow you into the training room back at Gearen Lab, nature changing mints, PP Ups, and Ability Capsules. There’s also an Exp. All, but I recommend holding off on buying it unless you really need it.

{: .text-blue-000}
AP Center

| ITEM               | PRICE  | ITEM                 | PRICE  |
|:-------------------|:-------|:---------------------|:-------|
| *Adamant Mint*     | 3 AP   | *Golden Lantern*     | 10 AP  |
| *Jolly Mint*       | 3 AP   | *Golden Surfboard*   | 10 AP  |
| *Brave Mint*       | 3 AP   | *Golden Gauntlet*    | 15 AP  |
| *Modest Mint*      | 3 AP   | *Golden Scuba Gear*  | 15 AP  |
| *Timid Mint*       | 3 AP   | *Golden Wings*       | 15 AP  |
| *Quiet Mint*       | 3 AP   | *Golden Jetpack*     | 20 AP  |
| *Calm Mint*        | 3 AP   | *Golden Drift Board* | 20 AP  |
| *Bold Mint*        | 3 AP   | *Golden Claws*       | 2 AP   |
| *Naughty Mint*     | 3 AP   | *Exp. All*           | 30 AP  |
| *Rash Mint*        | 3 AP   | *HP Card*            | 10 AP  |
| *Lonely Mint*      | 3 AP   | *Attack Card*        | 10 AP  |
| *Mild Mint*        | 3 AP   | *Defense Card*       | 10 AP  |
| *Ability Capsule*  | 3 AP   | *Speed Card*         | 10 AP  |
| *PP Up*            | 6 AP   | *SPAttack Card*      | 10 AP  |
| *Golden Axe*       | 10 AP  | *SPDefense Card*     | 10 AP  |

The cards allow you into each of their respective training rooms where you’ll find the respective Power item: *Power Anklet*, *Power Band*, *Power Belt*, *Power Bracer*, *Power Lens*, and *Power Weight*. I tend to focus on buying the golden items, starting with the Hammer since we get Rock Smash first.

That’s all we can do here for now so let’s go up to the rooftop where there are new Pokémon to greet us.

{: .text-blue-000}
Chrisola Rooftop (Right)

| GRASS: MORN  | %   | GRASS: DAY     | %   | GRASS: NIGHT | %   |
|:-------------|:----|:---------------|:----|:-------------|:----|
| **Skitty**   | 29% | **Paras**      | 29% | Purrloin     | 29% |
| **Caterpie** | 22% | **Caterpie**   | 22% | **Weedle**   | 22% |
| **Glameow**  | 25% | **Glameow**    | 25% | **Meowth**   | 25% |
| Meowth       | 10% | Meowth         | 10% | **Glameow**  | 10% |
| Bellsprout   | 4%  | Bellsprout     | 4%  | Oddish       | 4%  |

There’s an Audino breeder here that will make grinding a breeze. Each time you beat them you’ll get *3 Exp. Candy S*. In the center of the rooftop there’s also a white-haired trainer with a quest marker, but I highly recommend waiting before you interact with her.

There’s a hidden *Oran Berry* 3 tiles down and 2 to the right of the top left lamp post below the bench, a *Reverse Candy* diagonally left from the purple flower on the right in front of the helicopter pad, and a *Resist Wing* all the way to the right and up one tile from the bottom center lantern.

Go back into the elevator and grab yourself a *Repel* in the pool room, hidden in the first rack of towels along the top wall. More free money!

We’re done with the hotel for now, so let’s exit and go straight down in between the train station and the gym. There’s a *Reverse Candy* waiting for us to pick it up, and in the grass patch to the left there's a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* in the sixth patch of grass. 3 tiles to the right and 2 tiles up from the biker there’s a *Blue Shard* on the floor.

Ignore the gym and the house next to it for now and continue to the left, picking up the hidden *Repel* 3 tiles down and 5 tiles right of the blond trainer. Near the locked house below him you'll find a hidden *Heart Scale* in the barrels. Go up the bridge and interact with the dumpster across the hiker to get a hidden *Clever Wing*.

Head inside the Aqua Building. Pick up the *Iron* on the first floor as well as the *Old Rod*! There’s a mysterious tenant on the third floor that will battle you, but I don’t recommend it. She’ll seem easy at first until you get jumpscared by a level 80 Pokémon. Let’s just leave her alone for now and exit the building with no sudden movements.

Head back to the right and down to enter Gearen Park where you’ll find a new set of available Pokémon.

{: .text-blue-000}
Gearen Park 

| GRASS: MORN    | %   | GRASS: DAY    | %   | GRASS: NIGHT    | %   |
|:---------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:----------------|:----|
| **Pansage**    | 27% | **Pansear**   | 27% | **Panpour**     | 27% |
| **Spearow**    | 25% | **Spearow**   | 25% | **Spearow**     | 25% |
| **Psyduck**    | 15% | **Psyduck**   | 15% | **Psyduck**     | 15% |
| **Skwovet**    | 15% | **Skwovet**   | 15% | **Stunky**      | 15% |
| **Fomantis**   | 12% | **Fomantis**  | 12% | **Kricketot**   | 12% |

| **Mankey**     | 6%  | **Mankey**    | 6%  | **Mankey**      | 6%  |

The blue flowers to the right of the entrance have a *Blue Shard* hidden in them. There’s a hidden *Honey* to the right of the large rock formation in the tile next to it with no tall grass. Go down just a little bit to get a hidden *Carbos* in one of the flower patches of grass between the teal and dark green tree. Go back up and grab the other *Honey* in one of the purple flowers.

Keep going up to find a mysterious crack in the ground that spawns an endless amount of **Unowns** at night.

Go back around and towards the right to stand in front of the fountain. 3 tiles down from the rightmost lamp and 3 to the right will find you another *Yellow Shard*. Keep going up and grab the *Muscle Wing* hidden one tile down and to the right of the flower patch of grass in front of the tent.

Enter the tent and prepare for excellence.

{: .text-blue-000}
### Mr. Luck's Tent
---

This tent will serve as the hub for a number of things. For one, the Marshadow in front of the bookcase is a Move Tutor. More Marshadows will appear with better and better moves as you progress throughout the story.

{: .text-blue-000}
Marshie (Green Eyes)

| MOVE           | PRICE           |
|:---------------|:----------------|
| Bind           | 2 Red Shards    |
| Covet          | 2 Blue Shards   |
| Block          | 2 Yellow Shards |
| Spite          | 2 Green Shards  |
| Swift          | 2 Yellow Shards |
| After You      | 2 Red Shards    |
| Gravity        | 2 Green Shards  |
| Magic Coat     | 2 Blue Shards   |
| Venom Drench   | 2 Blue Shards   |

Nothing extraordinary, but a few that can be used in fun strats if you’d like. There’s a PC star on the rightmost wall if you wanna change out your Pokémon to teach them moves.

Talk to Mr. Luck when you’re ready, but be careful and make sure to read through his dialogue carefully. I wouldn’t want you to sign any contracts without your explicit consent, y’know? Unfortunately, signing Mr. Luck’s contract is actually the only way to continue with his quest, so we’re just going to have to hope for the best and sign it anyway!

Surprise, he’s changed you into the legacy design of your chosen character! Talk to him again and follow him to the room on the right to find out about Prism Pokémon and Black Prisms. If you’ve encountered a Pokémon with a rainbow aura then you’ve already figured out that they get a +2 to each stat at the start of the battle. You’ll have to catch the rainbow Pokémon to take the Black Prism off of it. Unfortunately, equipping that prism onto your own Pokémon won’t give us that stat boost, but at least your Pokémon will look pretty!

Prism Pokémon have a 1% spawn rate, so get to grinding if you want to change back to your original sprite.

Return to Mr. Luck once you have your new shiny Black Prism and complete the quest. Try and exit the room before Mr. Luck stops you, and you’ll unlock the Prism shop in his tent. Doxie provides items while Mr. Luck provides contracts that can change a variety of things in your playthrough.

{: .text-blue-000}
Doxie's Prism Shop

| ITEM                | PRICE           |
|:--------------------|:----------------|
| *10 Green Shards*   | 3 Black Prisms  |
| *10 Green Shards*   | 3 Black Prisms  |
| *10 Green Shards*   | 3 Black Prisms  |
| *10 Green Shards*   | 3 Black Prisms  |
| *4 Nuggets*         | 3 Black Prisms  |
| *3 Pearl Strings*   | 3 Black Prisms  |
| *2 Cell Imprints*    | 3 Black Prisms  |
| *3 Glitter Balls*   | 3 Black Prisms  |

Useful trades if you’re in desperate need of a few items! Cell Imprints change one chosen stat to have 31 IVs, while Glitter Balls have a higher chance of catching shiny Pokémon or change the caught Pokémon into a shiny.

Here’s where you can change the difficulty of the game, change your chosen protagonist sprite, or sign one of the many contracts that Mr. Luck has for you.

**The Technique Contract:** Makes Pokémon harder to catch for the next 20 encounters, but they can have rarer moves. What this means is that one of the moves in a Pokémons learn set is replaced with one move from its egg move, TM, or tutor move pool completely randomly. For example, if I encounter a Hoothoot it might replace Echoed Voice, a move that it learns at level 13, with Shadow Ball, a move that it can learn through TM. This contract works on wild Pokémon, Legendaries, static encounters like event Pokémon, and basically anything you can battle capture. It does NOT work on gift Pokémon, shadow and raid den Pokémon, and Pokémon that already come with four event moves.

**The Wealth Contract:** You won’t receive any prize money for the next 10 battles, but the following 10 will have double the money. This can kind of be useful if you time it right by fighting rich trainers, but overall is outclassed by items like an Amulet Coin later on.

**The Shiny Contract:** Shiny Pokémon are easier to find, but can run away suddenly like in Safari battles for the next 80 encounters. Trapping moves or abilities like Mean Look and Shadow Tag do not work on stopping these Pokémon from escaping. This contract works on Pokémon you can battle and catch and static event Pokémon. It does NOT work on gift Pokémon or Pokémon hatched from eggs.

You can stack different contracts together, but you can’t stack duplicate contracts.

If you’re eyeing that ??? ust remember that Mr. Luck knows all, and you signed a contract (even if you didn’t bother reading it) that said you’re not allowed to cheat. And if you actually do get it legitimately… well you’ll have to wait for your reward until much later in the game. Sorry!

Exit Gearen Park when you’re ready so we can finally continue the story! Enter the front yard of the house to the left of the gym to watch a cutscene, then go to the Berry Emporium to receive a Pecha Berry? From the clerk. Give it to the girl on the floor.

Head to the right and down to watch a cutscene play out between Venam and Ren and enter the sewers.

You’ll be accompanied by Ren in all trainer and wild battlers once you enter and he’ll graciously heal your party after every battle too! If you want to catch a Pokémon with Ren around, you’ll have to knock out the other Pokémon you don’t want to get, but you can always come back here alone later if you don’t want to deal with that.

Some stinky new Pokémon live here!

| LAND            | %   | LAND         | %   | OLD ROD          | %   |
|:----------------|:----|:-------------|:----|:--------------|:----|
| Alolan Rattata  | 30% | Poochyena    | 10% | **Grimer**   | 70% |
| **Trubbish**    | 15% | **Koffing**  | 9%  | **Qwilfish** | 30% |
| **Gulpin**      | 12% | **Noibat**   | 7%  |    |  |
| **Ekans**       | 10% | **Geodude**  | 2%  |    |  |

Qwilfish is an incredibly useful Pokémon, especially later in the game. With its Intimidate ability to weaken enemy Pokémon (especially in double battles) and Destiny Bond that can be boosted with Swift Swim if necessary, it’s a great addition for a lot of the boss battles. If you want Geodude and Noibat I recommend waiting until just right after the first gym, since they’re much more common then.

There’s a hidden *Poison Gem* south of the boy with the orange cap along the wall and a *Great Ball* if you go right after crossing the bridge. Don’t cross the bridge to the left just yet, instead go up and right to grab the hidden *Zinc* in the corner below the bridge near the bug catcher. There’s a *Bold Mint* here too. Above the girl there’s a hidden *Potion* and a second *Potion* hidden in the barrel to the right. The bug catcher also gives you a *Pecha Berry*.

Head back down and to the left to cross the bridge, and take another bridge down. If you got the girl to flush her case down, you’ll find yourself one *Coin Case* richer! There’s also a hidden *Reverse Candy* in the bottom left corner near the biker.

Go back up and left to talk to Venam. The door gets locked from the inside, so go to the left and into the open door after grabbing the *Antidote*. You’re gonna have to activate the 3rd generator, then the 1st, then the 2nd to get the door to open again. Prepare yourself for a battle and head inside to watch a cutscene.

### Ruthless Pokémon
---

Time for a quick lesson on Ruthless Pokémon! These are the signature Boss Pokémon here in Rejuvenation and modeled after the shield system in Raid Dens with a lot more fun mechanics and dynamics. Melia will give you some handy note cards to educate yourself if you haven’t played through the game before but I’ll summarize and explain further details on them here:
 - Each RP (Ruthless Pokémon) will have a set number of shields. Each shield is worth one full HP bar and when you break a shield you will trigger one of the shield break effects. After breaking the shields you will also have to knock out the RP on its own, so if you see a RP with 2 shields, you’ll have to lower that HP bar 3 times.
 - When a shield breaks the effect takes place immediately, not at the end of the turn. HOWEVER, if its moveset changes it will still pull from the old moveset, not the new one it just got.
 - Shield break effects can include one or multiple of the following: type changes, ability changes, field changes, weather changes, item changes, moveset changes, and stat changes. Pay attention to the text after a shield breaks as well as the type symbols in the UI so you’re never caught off guard!
 - RP can call for help by summoning other Pokémon. These Pokémon do not have shields but if you defeat the RP first, you’ll still need to defeat the summoned Pokémon. If they’re summoned in the middle of a turn, summoned Pokémon don’t move until the next turn.
 - You can PP stall a RP but once a shield breaks it may get a new move that will have its full PP. RP often change out their movesets so this strategy is not always completely viable unless you’re trying to set up for some kind of sweep or toxic stall.
 - You can status a RP, but it might cleanse itself between shield breaks depending on the specific boss battle.
 - Veteran players might remember that the old boss battles in Rejuvenation prohibited some moves to be used against RPs, but that’s no longer the case apart from a few restrictions. For example, Destiny Bond now works on RP but only once and only takes down one shield, after that it will always fail. Moves like Soak or Worry Seed also work, but some RP can cleanse themselves of those effects after a shield breaks.

For this guide I’ll be using a specific template to try and streamline as much of the information on these boss fights as possible. The first column will have details on what happens when the battle starts and any changes with each shield break. The middle column will include any changes to movesets, type, ability, or item and have it line up with the shield break that it occurs in. The third column (which might not always be there) will include details on the Pokémon that the RP can summon, also lined up with the shield break that they start appearing in.

Garbodor Boss Battle

They’ve kept it pretty simple for your first boss fight, just keep an eye on that type change when all the shields go down, especially if you’re relying on psychic moves. Fast, hard hitting Pokémon will do good things here, especially with Ren and his 3 Pokémon at your side. 

Watch the following cutscene until you gain control over yourself again. Before we do anything else let’s get the most important thing out of the way: gambling!

You can get coins by buying them or playing your way around the casino. Voltorb Flip is the most efficient out of these games if you know how to play, and even if you don’t there’s a website that can calculate results for you to the best of its ability. There's still a bit of luck involved, but it’s still the most reliable way to grind out coins.

Out of the prizes, Spoink is an easy choice for the first gym and Hidden Power is useful for adding variety to your movesets. We’ll also have to get Flash from here later, so you can grab it early if you’d like.

After you’ve spent the next seven or eight hours gambling your life away, exit the casino to get a few more optional friendship values with Melia in Gearen Park by watching the cutscene.

Finishing the cutscene gets you an even higher value. (Melia +3)

You can also go back to the library to fight Ren for some extra experience and cash!

A simple Pokémon battle, all things considered. It’s finally time to head to East Gearen’s gym! It’s located right next to Venam’s house.
