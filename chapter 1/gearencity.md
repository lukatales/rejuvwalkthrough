## GEAREN LAB

Walk directly north. Before entering the building pick up the hidden *Ice Heal* in the rock to the right.

Enter the lab and watch a cutscene. The woman to the left of Nurse Joy will explain more things about Rejuvenation's mechanics if you want clarification. The counter on the lower left of the first floor serves as out first PokéMart.

Gearen Lab Mart

| ITEM           | PRICE  |
|:---------------|:-------|
| *Potion*       | $300   |
| *Antidote*     | $100   |
| *Repel*        | $350   |
| *Poké Ball*    | $200   |

You start with $3000. Pick up some Poké Balls if you like. Repels are worthless in this game thanks to an item we'll get very soon, so I recommend never paying for any as well as selling any that you come across.

Head through the blue door in the top left, narrowly avoid getting run over, and meet this region's professor. You’ll be taken to a room where you can pick one of 24 starters organized by type and the generation they were introduced in. If you’d like, interact with the rainbow machine on the right side to get a randomly chosen starter.

You can quick save with ‘D’ in front of the starter you’d like and press ‘F12’ to soft reset for natures, shininess, and abilities. In this game all Pokémon can be shiny and have a chance to have their hidden ability. The base shiny rate is a little over 1%, and you can check for shininess in the nickname screen.

For those that’d like a strong starter to make the game a bit easier, Speed Boost Torchic is easily the most recommended option, followed by Libero Scorbunny and Protean Froakie. The first gym specializes in poison types, so grass types might have more of a difficult time in there, but all starters are viable in one way or another, so pick whatever you’d like! 

Once you’ve picked out your starter, talk to Amanda and get ready for a battle! You can win or lose this one.

Amanda Battle

You can press the ‘S’ key to check the stat changes of all the Pokémon on the field, as well as the field effect, weather, screens, and other nifty information. Amanda will give you 5 Poké Balls to get started after the battle.

Go back down to talk to Professor Jenner where you’ll fight Ren. You can win or lose this one too!

{: .text-blue-000}
Ren Battle

After battling, Jenner will ask you to check in on his daughter Melia on Route 1. For your trouble you get a *Pokédex* and a *Cybernav*! The Pokédex is self explanatory, but there’s a few features on the Cybernav that are very helpful to us. You can check where you are with the “Map” and change what music you’re listening to with the “Jukebox” apps. “Achievements” allows you to track your progress on all the achievements listed, and help you figure out what you need to do to complete them. “Spice Scent” essentially replaces the need for repels forever, as it changes the encounter rate. Don’t want to run back and forth waiting for an encounter? Set it to 9999 and you’ll be running into a Pokémon on every tile! Or you can set it to 0 and never run into any Pokémon at all! 

The “Move Tutor” app won’t become useful to us until later, but essentially any time you encounter a Move Tutor NPC out in the world and buy access to one of their moves you’ll have permanent access to it in this app. For example, if I spend 3 Red Shards to teach Explosion to one Pokémon in a far away city I won’t have to find that NPC again or spend those red shards ever again since I can access that move through this app and teach it to whoever else can learn it. Neat, huh?

Head back downstairs. There’s an EV training room on the far right, but none of the rooms are available to us right now. 

There are two NPCs that have side quests available to us in the Lab, evident by the exclamation marks floating above their heads. One is in the downstairs lobby area next to Nurse Joy, and the other is up the stairs in the Gearen Archive room, but I'll be covering both of them later. For now, just know that most sidequests can be tracked in the "Quest" section of the Menu. It’ll provide you with a small summary of each quest, other useful information like quest expiration date, and the location you have to go to next to continue the quest.

Finally, let’s exit the lab and explore what the city has to offer!

This guide won't be covering minor NPC trainers, but from this point forward you'll start to see field effects in battle. For more information on what field effect does you can visit the Field_Effect_Manual in your Rejuvenation folder, or visit the Field Effect Manual page on this guide. I'll also be covering relevant effects and strategies for major battles.

The patches of grass around East Gearen have opened so consider catching some Pokémon!

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City (Left)

| GRASS: MORN        | %   | GRASS: DAY      | %   | GRASS: NIGHT        | %   |
|:-------------------|:----|:----------------|:----|:--------------------|:----|
| **Wurmple**        | 27% | **Wurmple**     | 27% | **Wurmple**         | 27% |
| **Alolan Rattata** | 25% | **Bidoof**      | 25% | **Alolan Rattata**  | 25% |
| **Patrat**         | 15% | **Patrat**      | 15% | **Poochyena**       | 15% |
| **Pidgey**         | 15% | **Pidove**      | 15% | **Hoothoot**        | 15% |
| **Bellsprout**     | 12% | **Bellsprout**  | 12% | **Oddish**          | 12% |
| **Sunkern**        | 6%  | **Sunkern**     | 6%  | **Chingling**       | 6%  |

Wurmple evolving into Dustox is good for the first gym, as well as Chingling and Hoothoot. Alolan Rattata is also a certified beast in early game with the boosts it gets in City Field, as well as its significant speed.

There’s a *Gourmet Treat* in a flowery tile in the grass patch below the lab, to the left of the round bush. These treats are used to encounter some event Pokémon, so make sure to always have a few on hand!

Below that patch of grass there's a rock with a hidden *Poké Ball* in it. If you go to the right and down and talk to the nerd, he’ll give you a *Reverse Candy*. Below him and to the right there’s a rock with a *Potion*, and to the right there’s another rock with a *Green Shard*.  Go north of the charmer that battles you and in the patch of lighter colored grass to the right of the girl there's a hidden *Oran Berry*.

Head back down toward Oceana Pier. There’s a **Nidoran M** looking for food and you can feed it a Gourmet Treat for a battle.

The garden to the south is now open, and you’ll be able to battle the **Fletchling** there if you interact with them. There’s an *X Accuracy* to the right of  the middle bottom blue and white flower tile, and a *Sweet Heart* in the other flower patch of grass in the bottom right corner.

Enter the building on the west side labeled “Ferry Terminal.” Talk to the blonde guy and exit the building to watch the Buizel run by. This starts a quest for later.

Back in East Gearen, let’s start going through all the buildings. To the left of the lab is the Velvet Building. Go up the elevator to the first floor and talk to the woman in the middle. Choose left and she’ll give you a *Mineral Ball*, choose right and you’ll get a *Steam Ball*. Pick up the *Great Ball* in the lower left corner and go to the second floor where you’ll be able to battle a **Pachirisu** if you give it a Gourmet Treat at nighttime and grab a *Potion*. On the third floor there’s an *Exp. Candy XS*. Exit the building.

In the house next door there's a repel that you can sell for some quick cash because of the lovely Spice Scent app.

Exit and go to the right, all the way to where you fought that charmer and go up past the bridge. Going further up will find you a **Nidoran F** that will run away from you and go to one of the following locations. It will give you a hint on which direction it’s heading when it runs away:
 - To the right of the Route 1 train station
 - In front of the Help Plaza
 - To the left of the tree where you battled that Charmer
 - To the right of the Purple Building where you can battle it

Go to the Emerald Building and talk to the lady in the green dress, then beat the guy in front of the elevator to be able to use it. The second floor will have a *Red Shard* in the bottom left corner. Talking to the red-haired girl will grant you a *Full Heal*, talking to the old woman will grant you a *Super Repel*, and talking to the brown haired lady will grant you a *Chesto Berry*. Enter the third floor at night time for the chance to battle a level 5 **Shuppet**. Ghost Pokémon that can learn Curse, and any Pokémon that can learn Destiny Bond for that matter, are incredibly valuable to help with some of the harder boss fights in the game, so consider catching it.

Exit and go further left to find a Help Plaza. This building acts as a hub for most of the sidequests in the game. As stated before, you can find sidequests both here and in the overworld - and some side quests won’t be connected to a Help Plaza at all, so be vigilant in your travels. I’ll be covering all of the sidequests found here later.

Next to the Plaza you’ll find the library where you can enter for $300, but there’s really no need to just yet. Instead, take the stairs and talk to the person on the far right of the room. This is Zumi and she’ll give us a quest to find and catch a Dedenne, a task we’ll keep note of for later.

On the bridge next to this building you’ll be blocked by a thug who will force you to cough up $300 dollars or battle him to get passed. He uses 3 12-13 level Pokémon, so only battle him if you’re ready.

Since this is your first real “hurdle,” now’s a good time to talk about what happens after you white out after losing a battle. You’ll be transported to a pastel paradise where your Pokémon will be healed. There’s a PC to swap out your team and on the table there will be some Exp. Candies that differ in size depending on where you’re at in the game. Stepping on the warp pad at the bottom teleports you back to the last Pokémon Center/safe place you went to. It’s a nice hub to rethink strategies and take a breather after losing.

Beating the thug in a battle will grant you (+1 Karma), a variable used to track your good deeds around Aevium.

Hidden in the rock in the patch of grass is a *Super Potion*. There’s also a *Red Shard* to the right of the guard blocking the station entrance in one of the flower patches of grass.

Head all the way back toward the right to enter the next section of East Gearen City. We’re not even close to being done!

Some more patches of grass here, this time with a slightly different set of Pokémon.

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City (Right)

| GRASS: MORN    | %   | GRASS: DAY     | %   | GRASS: NIGHT     | %   |
|:---------------|:----|:---------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|
| **Paras**      | 29% | **Paras**      | 29% | **Jigglypuff**   | 29% |
| Alolan Rattata | 25% | Bidoof         | 25% | Alolan Rattata   | 25% |
| Patrat         | 17% | Patrat         | 17% | Poochyena        | 17% |
| **Pidgey**     | 15% | Pidove         | 15% | Hoothoot         | 15% |
| **Klink**      | 4%  | **Bellsprout** | 4%  | **Klink**        | 4%  |

Catch a female Jigglypuff to breed later.

There’s a few more shops to look through! First off, talk to the black belt in front of the Lilligant sign. He’s selling IPoké Balls* for $400 a pop which is definitely a rip off. However, if you buy four he’ll accidently give you a **Voltorb**!

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City Mart

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Burn Heal*      | $250   |
| *Potion*         | $300   |
| *Gourmet Treat*  | $1500  |
| *Repel*          | $350   |
| *Reverse Cancy*  | $50    |

Here’s a good spot to sell all those repels you don’t need anymore. You can also sell any vitamins or wings since EV training items are easier to come by. Reverse Candies don’t seem incredibly useful until you realize that you can use Rare Candies to over level yourself past the hard cap to evolve or learn a move, then use the Reverse Candy to get yourself back down to the cap so your Pokémon doesn’t become truant. I recommend buying a couple of Gourmet Treats if you’re already out as well, since they’re always good to have on hand.

Next to the mart there’s a guy next to a truck. He’s going to be how we fast travel around Floria Island, but we can’t do anything with him right now.

Enter the Petal Salon. They sell haircuts on the top floor but you can’t get those until you finish a quest. For now just enjoy the berries sold on the first floor

{: .text-blue-000}
Berry Emporium

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Oran Berry*     | $200   |
| *Pecha Berry*    | $300   |

Consider getting a few of each for the early game.

The building above sells specialty Poké Balls.

{: .text-blue-000}
Poké Ball Boutique

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Heavy Ball*     | $200   |
| *Moon Ball*      | $300   |

The rock to the right of the boutique that’s sitting in a patch of grass holds a hidden *Potion*. Go up and through the fence to get a *Super Repel* hidden in the rock to the right, as well as the *Super Potion* laying there to the left. There’s also a hidden *Resist Wing* in the rock behind the *Super Potion*.

To the left of the berry filled backyard there’s an alleyway with new Pokémon.
