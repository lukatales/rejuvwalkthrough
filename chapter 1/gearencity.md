## Gearen Lab
---
Walk directly north. Before entering the building pick up the hidden *Ice Heal* in the rock to the right.

Enter the lab and watch a cutscene. The woman to the left of Nurse Joy will explain more things about Rejuvenation's mechanics if you want clarification. The counter on the lower left of the first floor serves as out first PokéMart.

**GEAREN LAB MART**

| ITEM           | PRICE  |
|:---------------|:-------|
| *Potion*       | $300   |
| *Antidote*     | $100   |
| *Repel*        | $350   |
| *Poké Ball*    | $200   |

You start with $3000. Pick up some Poké Balls if you like. Repels are worthless in this game thanks to an item we'll get very soon, so I recommend never paying for any as well as selling any that you come across.

Head through the blue door in the top left, narrowly avoid getting run over, and meet this region's professor. You’ll be taken to a room where you can pick one of 24 starters organized by type and the generation they were introduced in. If you’d like, interact with the rainbow machine on the right side to get a randomly chosen starter.

You can quick save with ‘D’ in front of the starter you’d like and press ‘F12’ to soft reset for natures, shininess, and abilities. In this game all Pokémon can be shiny and have a chance to have their hidden ability. The base shiny rate is a little over 1%, and you can check for shininess in the nickname screen.

For those that’d like a strong starter to make the game a bit easier, Speed Boost Torchic is easily the most recommended option, followed by Libero Scorbunny and Protean Froakie. The first gym specializes in poison types, so grass types might have more of a difficult time in there, but all starters are viable in one way or another, so pick whatever you’d like! 

Once you’ve picked out your starter, talk to Amanda and get ready for a battle! You can win or lose this one.

**AMANDA BATTLE**

You can press the ‘S’ key to check the stat changes of all the Pokémon on the field, as well as the field effect, weather, screens, and other nifty information. Amanda will give you 5 Poké Balls to get started after the battle.

Go back down to talk to Professor Jenner where you’ll fight Ren. You can win or lose this one too!

**REN BATTLE**

After battling, Jenner will ask you to check in on his daughter Melia on Route 1. For your trouble you get a *Pokédex* and a *Cybernav*! The Pokédex is self explanatory, but there’s a few features on the Cybernav that are very helpful to us. You can check where you are with the “Map” and change what music you’re listening to with the “Jukebox” apps. “Achievements” allows you to track your progress on all the achievements listed, and help you figure out what you need to do to complete them. “Spice Scent” essentially replaces the need for repels forever, as it changes the encounter rate. Don’t want to run back and forth waiting for an encounter? Set it to 9999 and you’ll be running into a Pokémon on every tile! Or you can set it to 0 and never run into any Pokémon at all! 

The “Move Tutor” app won’t become useful to us until later, but essentially any time you encounter a Move Tutor NPC out in the world and buy access to one of their moves you’ll have permanent access to it in this app. For example, if I spend 3 Red Shards to teach Explosion to one Pokémon in a far away city I won’t have to find that NPC again or spend those red shards ever again since I can access that move through this app and teach it to whoever else can learn it. Neat, huh?

Head back downstairs. There’s an EV training room on the far right, but none of the rooms are available to us right now. 

There are two NPCs that have side quests available to us in the Lab, evident by the exclamation marks floating above their heads. One is in the downstairs lobby area next to Nurse Joy, and the other is up the stairs in the Gearen Archive room, but I'll be covering both of them later. For now, just know that most sidequests can be tracked in the "Quest" section of the Menu. It’ll provide you with a small summary of each quest, other useful information like quest expiration date, and the location you have to go to next to continue the quest.

Finally, let’s exit the lab and explore what the city has to offer!

This guide won't be covering minor NPC trainers, but from this point forward you'll start to see field effects in battle. For more information on what field effect does you can visit the Field_Effect_Manual in your Rejuvenation folder, or visit the Field Effect Manual page on this guide. I'll also be covering relevant effects and strategies for major battles.

The patches of grass around East Gearen have opened so consider catching some Pokémon!

| GRASS: MORN         | %   | GRASS: DAY       | %   | GRASS: NIGHT         | %   |
|:--------------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|:---------------------|:----|
| **Wurmple**        | 27% | **Wurmple**     | 27% | **Wurmple**         | 27% |
| **Alolan Rattata** | 25% | **Bidoof**      | 25% | **Alolan Rattata**  | 25% |

| **Sunkern**        | 6%  | **Sunkern**     | 6%  | **Chingling**       | 6%  |

Wurmple evolving into Dustox is good for the first gym, as well as Chingling and Hoothoot. Alolan Rattata is also a certified beast in early game with the boosts it gets in City Field, as well as its significant speed.

There’s a *Gourmet Treat* in a flowery tile in the grass patch below the lab, to the left of the round bush. These treats are used to encounter some event Pokémon, so make sure to always have a few on hand!

Below that patch of grass there's a rock with a hidden *Poké Ball* in it. If you go to the right and down and talk to the nerd, he’ll give you a *Reverse Candy*. Below him and to the right there’s a rock with a *Potion*, and to the right there’s another rock with a *Green Shard*.  Go north of the charmer that battles you and in the patch of lighter colored grass to the right of the girl there's a hidden *Oran Berry*.
