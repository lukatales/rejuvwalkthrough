## GEAREN LAB
---
Walk directly north. Before entering the building pick up the hidden *Ice Heal* in the rock to the right.

Enter the lab and watch a cutscene. The woman to the left of Nurse Joy will explain more things about Rejuvenation's mechanics if you want clarification. The counter on the lower left of the first floor serves as out first PokéMart.

{: .text-blue-000}
Gearen Lab Mart

| ITEM           | PRICE  |
|:---------------|:-------|
| *Potion*       | $300   |
| *Antidote*     | $100   |
| *Repel*        | $350   |
| *Poké Ball*    | $200   |

You start with $3000. Pick up some Poké Balls if you like. Repels are worthless in this game thanks to an item we'll get very soon, so I recommend never paying for any as well as selling any that you come across.

Head through the blue door in the top left, narrowly avoid getting run over, and meet this region's professor. You’ll be taken to a room where you can pick one of 24 starters organized by type and the generation they were introduced in. If you’d like, interact with the rainbow machine on the right side to get a randomly chosen starter.

You can quick save with ‘D’ in front of the starter you’d like and press ‘F12’ to soft reset for natures, shininess, and abilities. In this game all Pokémon can be shiny and have a chance to have their hidden ability. The base shiny rate is a little over 1%, and you can check for shininess in the nickname screen.

For those that’d like a strong starter to make the game a bit easier, Speed Boost Torchic is easily the most recommended option, followed by Libero Scorbunny and Protean Froakie. The first gym specializes in poison types, so grass types might have more of a difficult time in there, but all starters are viable in one way or another, so pick whatever you’d like! 

Once you’ve picked out your starter, talk to Amanda and get ready for a battle! You can win or lose this one.

{: .text-blue-000}
Amanda Battle

You can press the ‘S’ key to check the stat changes of all the Pokémon on the field, as well as the field effect, weather, screens, and other nifty information. Amanda will give you 5 Poké Balls to get started after the battle.

Go back down to talk to Professor Jenner where you’ll fight Ren. You can win or lose this one too!

{: .text-blue-000}
Ren Battle

After battling, Jenner will ask you to check in on his daughter Melia on Route 1. For your trouble you get a *Pokédex* and a *Cybernav*! The Pokédex is self explanatory, but there’s a few features on the Cybernav that are very helpful to us. You can check where you are with the “Map” and change what music you’re listening to with the “Jukebox” apps. “Achievements” allows you to track your progress on all the achievements listed, and help you figure out what you need to do to complete them. “Spice Scent” essentially replaces the need for repels forever, as it changes the encounter rate. Don’t want to run back and forth waiting for an encounter? Set it to 9999 and you’ll be running into a Pokémon on every tile! Or you can set it to 0 and never run into any Pokémon at all! 

The “Move Tutor” app won’t become useful to us until later, but essentially any time you encounter a Move Tutor NPC out in the world and buy access to one of their moves you’ll have permanent access to it in this app. For example, if I spend 3 Red Shards to teach Explosion to one Pokémon in a far away city I won’t have to find that NPC again or spend those red shards ever again since I can access that move through this app and teach it to whoever else can learn it. Neat, huh?

Head back downstairs. There’s an EV training room on the far right, but none of the rooms are available to us right now. 

There are two NPCs that have side quests available to us in the Lab, evident by the exclamation marks floating above their heads. One is in the downstairs lobby area next to Nurse Joy, and the other is up the stairs in the Gearen Archive room, but I'll be covering both of them later. For now, just know that most sidequests can be tracked in the "Quest" section of the Menu. It’ll provide you with a small summary of each quest, other useful information like quest expiration date, and the location you have to go to next to continue the quest.

Finally, let’s exit the lab and explore what the city has to offer!

This guide won't be covering minor NPC trainers, but from this point forward you'll start to see field effects in battle. For more information on what field effect does you can visit the Field_Effect_Manual in your Rejuvenation folder, or visit the Field Effect Manual page on this guide. I'll also be covering relevant effects and strategies for major battles.

The patches of grass around East Gearen have opened so consider catching some Pokémon!

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City (Left)

| GRASS: MORN        | %   | GRASS: DAY      | %   | GRASS: NIGHT        | %   |
|:-------------------|:----|:----------------|:----|:--------------------|:----|
| **Wurmple**        | 27% | **Wurmple**     | 27% | **Wurmple**         | 27% |
| **Alolan Rattata** | 25% | **Bidoof**      | 25% | **Alolan Rattata**  | 25% |
| **Patrat**         | 15% | **Patrat**      | 15% | **Poochyena**       | 15% |
| **Pidgey**         | 15% | **Pidove**      | 15% | **Hoothoot**        | 15% |
| **Bellsprout**     | 12% | **Bellsprout**  | 12% | **Oddish**          | 12% |
| **Sunkern**        | 6%  | **Sunkern**     | 6%  | **Chingling**       | 6%  |

Wurmple evolving into Dustox is good for the first gym, as well as Chingling and Hoothoot. Alolan Rattata is also a certified beast in early game with the boosts it gets in City Field, as well as its significant speed.

There’s a *Gourmet Treat* in a flowery tile in the grass patch below the lab, to the left of the round bush. These treats are used to encounter some event Pokémon, so make sure to always have a few on hand!

Below that patch of grass there's a rock with a hidden *Poké Ball* in it. If you go to the right and down and talk to the nerd, he’ll give you a *Reverse Candy*. Below him and to the right there’s a rock with a *Potion*, and to the right there’s another rock with a *Green Shard*.  Go north of the charmer that battles you and in the patch of lighter colored grass to the right of the girl there's a hidden *Oran Berry*.

Head back down toward Oceana Pier. There’s a **Nidoran M** looking for food and you can feed it a Gourmet Treat for a battle.

The garden to the south is now open, and you’ll be able to battle the **Fletchling** there if you interact with them. There’s an *X Accuracy* to the right of  the middle bottom blue and white flower tile, and a *Sweet Heart* in the other flower patch of grass in the bottom right corner.

Enter the building on the west side labeled “Ferry Terminal.” Talk to the blonde guy and exit the building to watch the Buizel run by. This starts a quest for later.

Back in East Gearen, let’s start going through all the buildings. To the left of the lab is the Velvet Building. Go up the elevator to the first floor and talk to the woman in the middle. Choose left and she’ll give you a *Mineral Ball*, choose right and you’ll get a *Steam Ball*. Pick up the *Great Ball* in the lower left corner and go to the second floor where you’ll be able to battle a **Pachirisu** if you give it a Gourmet Treat at nighttime and grab a *Potion*. On the third floor there’s an *Exp. Candy XS*. Exit the building.

In the house next door there's a repel that you can sell for some quick cash because of the lovely Spice Scent app.

Exit and go to the right, all the way to where you fought that charmer and go up past the bridge. Going further up will find you a **Nidoran F** that will run away from you and go to one of the following locations. It will give you a hint on which direction it’s heading when it runs away:
 - To the right of the Route 1 train station
 - In front of the Help Plaza
 - To the left of the tree where you battled that Charmer
 - To the right of the Purple Building where you can battle it

Go to the Emerald Building and talk to the lady in the green dress, then beat the guy in front of the elevator to be able to use it. The second floor will have a *Red Shard* in the bottom left corner. Talking to the red-haired girl will grant you a *Full Heal*, talking to the old woman will grant you a *Super Repel*, and talking to the brown haired lady will grant you a *Chesto Berry*. Enter the third floor at night time for the chance to battle a level 5 **Shuppet**. Ghost Pokémon that can learn Curse, and any Pokémon that can learn Destiny Bond for that matter, are incredibly valuable to help with some of the harder boss fights in the game, so consider catching it.

Exit and go further left to find a Help Plaza. This building acts as a hub for most of the sidequests in the game. As stated before, you can find sidequests both here and in the overworld - and some side quests won’t be connected to a Help Plaza at all, so be vigilant in your travels. I’ll be covering all of the sidequests found here later.

Next to the Plaza you’ll find the library where you can enter for $300, but there’s really no need to just yet. Instead, take the stairs and talk to the person on the far right of the room. This is Zumi and she’ll give us a quest to find and catch a Dedenne, a task we’ll keep note of for later.

On the bridge next to this building you’ll be blocked by a thug who will force you to cough up $300 dollars or battle him to get passed. He uses 3 12-13 level Pokémon, so only battle him if you’re ready.

Since this is your first real “hurdle,” now’s a good time to talk about what happens after you white out after losing a battle. You’ll be transported to a pastel paradise where your Pokémon will be healed. There’s a PC to swap out your team and on the table there will be some Exp. Candies that differ in size depending on where you’re at in the game. Stepping on the warp pad at the bottom teleports you back to the last Pokémon Center/safe place you went to. It’s a nice hub to rethink strategies and take a breather after losing.

Beating the thug in a battle will grant you (+1 Karma), a variable used to track your good deeds around Aevium.

Hidden in the rock in the patch of grass is a *Super Potion*. There’s also a *Red Shard* to the right of the guard blocking the station entrance in one of the flower patches of grass.

Head all the way back toward the right to enter the next section of East Gearen City. We’re not even close to being done!

Some more patches of grass here, this time with a slightly different set of Pokémon.

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City (Right)

| GRASS: MORN    | %   | GRASS: DAY     | %   | GRASS: NIGHT     | %   |
|:---------------|:----|:---------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|
| **Paras**      | 29% | **Paras**      | 29% | **Jigglypuff**   | 29% |
| Alolan Rattata | 25% | Bidoof         | 25% | Alolan Rattata   | 25% |
| Patrat         | 17% | Patrat         | 17% | Poochyena        | 17% |
| **Pidgey**     | 15% | Pidove         | 15% | Hoothoot         | 15% |
| **Klink**      | 4%  | **Bellsprout** | 4%  | **Klink**        | 4%  |

Catch a female Jigglypuff to breed later.

There’s a few more shops to look through! First off, talk to the black belt in front of the Lilligant sign. He’s selling IPoké Balls* for $400 a pop which is definitely a rip off. However, if you buy four he’ll accidently give you a **Voltorb**!

{: .text-blue-000}
East Gearen City Mart

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Burn Heal*      | $250   |
| *Potion*         | $300   |
| *Gourmet Treat*  | $1500  |
| *Repel*          | $350   |
| *Reverse Cancy*  | $50    |

Here’s a good spot to sell all those repels you don’t need anymore. You can also sell any vitamins or wings since EV training items are easier to come by. Reverse Candies don’t seem incredibly useful until you realize that you can use Rare Candies to over level yourself past the hard cap to evolve or learn a move, then use the Reverse Candy to get yourself back down to the cap so your Pokémon doesn’t become truant. I recommend buying a couple of Gourmet Treats if you’re already out as well, since they’re always good to have on hand.

Next to the mart there’s a guy next to a truck. He’s going to be how we fast travel around Floria Island, but we can’t do anything with him right now.

Enter the Petal Salon. They sell haircuts on the top floor but you can’t get those until you finish a quest. For now just enjoy the berries sold on the first floor

{: .text-blue-000}
Berry Emporium

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Oran Berry*     | $200   |
| *Pecha Berry*    | $300   |

Consider getting a few of each for the early game.

The building above sells specialty Poké Balls.

{: .text-blue-000}
Poké Ball Boutique

| ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Heavy Ball*     | $200   |
| *Moon Ball*      | $300   |

The rock to the right of the boutique that’s sitting in a patch of grass holds a hidden *Potion*. Go up and through the fence to get a *Super Repel* hidden in the rock to the right, as well as the *Super Potion* laying there to the left. There’s also a hidden *Resist Wing* in the rock behind the *Super Potion*.

To the left of the berry filled backyard there’s an alleyway with new Pokémon.

{: .text-blue-000}
Gearen Alleyway

| LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   |
|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|
| **Purrloin**  | 35% | **Drowzee**   | 32% | **Rattata**   | 20% |
| Pidgey        | 10% | Klink         | 4% |    |  |

There’s a *Red Shard* hidden on the floor 3 tiles four tiles right and two tiles up from the trainer, a *Blue Shard* in the rock along the bottom, and a *Rare Candy* in the rock at the top.

Exit the alleyway, go down and then all the way to the right until you hit the ocean. You’ll see a **Buizel** staring sadly off into the ocean. Interact with it and win the battle against its old trainer to get it to join your team!

Go up but don’t pass the hedges yet. Pick up the hidden *Paralyze Heal* on the left fence before entering the area. There’s an Iron in the upper left corner and a *Green Shard* in the blue and white flower tile  right before the maze entrance. In the maze you’ll find an *Antidote* in the top right, a hidden *Revive* in the bottom right (in a blue and white flower tile), a hidden *Repel* in the rock in the middle, and a hidden *Red Shard* next to *TM83 - Infestation*!

Enter the Crisola Hotel.

{: .text-blue-000}
### Chrisola Hotel
---

Watch a short cutscene where you almost get run over by a Ms. Blakeory. Oops! (Saki +1)

After regaining control you can talk to the black belt in the bottom right corner for a free *Super Potio*. Go to the right hallway and grab *TM126 - Whirlpool* in the first open room you see. Circle around to the left and enter the middle room. Stand on the tile 1 down and 1 to the right of the upper left plant and hit the interact button when facing the bed to get $1500!

Go back to the lobby and go to the elevator to head to the Casino/AP Center. Talk to the girl with red hair to get her to flush her Coin Case down the toilet so we can pick it up later.

If you’ve been paying attention to the achievement pop ups you’ve noticed that you’ve been earning something called “AP,” or Achievement Points. Talk to the Lass next to the counter on the right to receive an Achievement Card that will help you check out how many AP you have anywhere you go. AP points are used to buy things from this counter like HM items that allow you to use HM moves without wasting a moveslot, cards to allow you into the training room back at Gearen Lab, nature changing mints, PP Ups, and Ability Capsules. There’s also an Exp. All, but I recommend holding off on buying it unless you really need it.

{: .text-blue-000}
AP Center

| ITEM             | PRICE  | ITEM             | PRICE  |
|:-----------------|:-------|:-----------------|:-------|
| *Poké Ball*      | $200   | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Burn Heal*      | $250   | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Potion*         | $300   | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Gourmet Treat*  | $1500  | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Repel*          | $350   | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Reverse Cancy*  | $50    | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Potion*         | $300   | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Gourmet Treat*  | $1500  | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Repel*          | $350   | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |
| *Reverse Cancy*  | $50    | *Poké Ball*      | $200   |

The cards allow you into each of their respective training rooms where you’ll find the respective Power item: *Power Anklet*, *Power Band*, *Power Belt*, *Power Bracer*, *Power Lens*, and *Power Weight*. I tend to focus on buying the golden items, starting with the Hammer since we get Rock Smash first.

That’s all we can do here for now so let’s go up to the rooftop where there are new Pokémon to greet us.

{: .text-blue-000}
Chrisola Rooftop (Right)

| GRASS: MORN    | %   | GRASS: DAY     | %   | GRASS: NIGHT     | %   |
|:---------------|:----|:---------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|
| **Paras**      | 29% | **Paras**      | 29% | **Jigglypuff**   | 29% |
| Alolan Rattata | 25% | Bidoof         | 25% | Alolan Rattata   | 25% |
| Patrat         | 17% | Patrat         | 17% | Poochyena        | 17% |
| **Pidgey**     | 15% | Pidove         | 15% | Hoothoot         | 15% |
| **Klink**      | 4%  | **Bellsprout** | 4%  | **Klink**        | 4%  |

There’s an Audino breeder here that will make grinding a breeze. Each time you beat them you’ll get *3 Exp. Candy S*. In the center of the rooftop there’s also a white-haired trainer with a quest marker, but I highly recommend waiting before you interact with her.

There’s a hidden *Oran Berry* 3 tiles down and 2 to the right of the top left lamp post below the bench, a *Reverse Candy* diagonally left from the purple flower on the right in front of the helicopter pad, and a *Resist Wing* all he way to the right and up one tile from the bottom center lantern.

Go back into the elevator and grab yourself a *Repel* in the pool room, hidden in the first rack of towels along the top wall. More free money!

We’re done with the hotel for now, so let’s exit and go straight down in between the train station and the gym. There’s a *Reverse Candy* waiting for us to pick it up, and in the grass patch to the left there's a hidden *Tiny Mushroom* in the sixth patch of grass. 3 tiles to the right and 2 tiles up from the biker there’s a *Blue Shard* on the floor.

Ignore the gym and the house next to it for now and continue to the left where you can enter the Aqua Building. Pick up the *Iron* on the first floor as well as the *Old Rod*! There’s a mysterious tenant on the third floor that will battle you, but I don’t recommend it. She’ll seem easy at first until you get jumpscared by a level 80 Pokémon. Let’s just leave her alone for now and exit the building with no sudden movements.

Head back to the right and down to enter Gearen Park where you’ll find a new set of available Pokémon.

{: .text-blue-000}
Gearen Park (Right)

| GRASS: MORN    | %   | GRASS: DAY     | %   | GRASS: NIGHT     | %   |
|:---------------|:----|:---------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|
| **Paras**      | 29% | **Paras**      | 29% | **Jigglypuff**   | 29% |
| Alolan Rattata | 25% | Bidoof         | 25% | Alolan Rattata   | 25% |
| Patrat         | 17% | Patrat         | 17% | Poochyena        | 17% |
| **Pidgey**     | 15% | Pidove         | 15% | Hoothoot         | 15% |
| **Klink**      | 4%  | **Bellsprout** | 4%  | **Klink**        | 4%  |

The blue flowers to the right of the entrance have a *Blue Shard* hidden in them. There’s a hidden *Honey* to the right of the large rock formation in the tile next to it with no tall grass. Go down just a little bit to get a hidden *Carbos* in one of the flower patches of grass between the teal and dark green tree. Go back up and grab the other *Honey* in one of the purple flowers.

Keep going up to find a mysterious crack in the ground that spawns an endless amount of **Unowns** at night.

Go back around and towards the right to stand in front of the fountain. 3 tiles down from the rightmost lamp and 3 to the right will find you another *Yellow Shard*. Keep going up and grab the *Muscle Wing* hidden one tile down and to the right of the flower patch of grass in front of the tent.

Enter the tent and prepare for excellence.

### Mr. Luck's Tent

This tent will serve as the hub for a number of things. For one, the Marshadow in front of the bookcase is a Move Tutor. More Marshadows will appear with better and better moves as you progress throughout the story.
