## East Gearen City

Walk directly north. Before entering the building pick up the hidden *Ice Heal* in the rock to the right.

Enter the lab and watch a cutscene. The woman to the left of Nurse Joy will explain more things about Rejuvenation's mechanics if you want clarification. The counter on the lower left of the first floor serves as out first Pok√©Mart.
