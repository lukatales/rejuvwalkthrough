## PROLOGUE

Once you start the game, it will show you a list of warnings, then ask if you would like to skip the prologue. If this is your first playthrough, I would recommend playing through it, but skipping it does not affect any story decisions later on.

After reading through the Zorua and Pangoro story, take Maria downstairs to talk to Mom. Afterwards, enter the bottom room on the left wall and go down the stairs. Go up and interact with the strange table in the center of the room.

Climb back up the stairs and go into the top room along the left wall to talk to Dad, then return to the kitchen to talk to Mom. Go back to your room upstairs. After a short cutscene where you’ll hear the sound of breaking glass, go back downstairs to talk to a mysterious figure. Return down to the room with the strange table.

Go down, right, and up towards the entrance and watch the end of the prologue.

## Intro and Passwords

The game will now ask you what difficulty you would like to play on. I recommend Story mode for those that are more interested in the story, characters, and lore and are not interested in spending too much time figuring out hard battles, and Classic Mode for those that would like a bit more challenge and enjoy a puzzling battle or two. Regardless of what choice you make, you will be able to change the difficulty later. This guide will cover battles as they appear in **Classic Mode.**

Before registering, you’ll have a chance to review and rebind your controls with ‘F1.’ Register yourself as a trainer by picking your gender, character design, and name.

You’ll be asked if you want to put down any passwords. Passwords are used to change the game by adding or removing difficulty, providing QOL, or introduce other possibly strange interactions. Here are the following available passwords and what they do:

If this is your first playthrough, I wouldn’t stress too much about passwords. Focus on the QOL ones if you’d like to make life a little easier for yourself or if you have a need to change the difficulty a little bit. You’ll be able to add or remove passwords later. Don’t enter the same password again if you’re using a password pack.
