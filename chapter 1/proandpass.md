## PROLOGUE
---
Once you start the game, it will show you a list of warnings, then ask if you would like to skip the prologue. If this is your first playthrough, I would recommend playing through it, but skipping it does not affect any story decisions later on. Wurmple

After reading through the Zorua and Pangoro story, take Maria downstairs to talk to Mom. Afterwards, enter the bottom room on the left wall and go down the stairs. Go up and interact with the strange table in the center of the room.

Climb back up the stairs and go into the top room along the left wall to talk to Dad, then return to the kitchen to talk to Mom. Go back to your room upstairs. After a short cutscene where you’ll hear the sound of breaking glass, go back downstairs to talk to a mysterious figure. Return down to the room with the strange table.

Go down, right, and up towards the entrance and watch the end of the prologue.

## INTRO AND PASSWORDS
---
The game will now ask you what difficulty you would like to play on. I recommend Story mode for those that are more interested in the story, characters, and lore and are not interested in spending too much time figuring out hard battles, and Classic Mode for those that would like a bit more challenge and enjoy a puzzling battle or two. Regardless of what choice you make, you will be able to change the difficulty later. This guide will cover battles as they appear in **Classic Mode.**

Before registering, you’ll have a chance to review and rebind your controls with ‘F1.’ Register yourself as a trainer by picking your gender, character design, and name.

You’ll be asked if you want to put down any passwords. Passwords are used to change the game by adding or removing difficulty, providing QOL, or introduce other possibly strange interactions. Here are the following available passwords and what they do:

Don’t enter the same password again if you’re using a password pack.

## S.S. OCEANA
---
After you’re done registering, exit the room to talk to your mom. The game will teach you about friendship values and how dialogue will affect how other characters will see you. Depending on your actions and dialogue you might see music notes above a character's head. Blue or gold music notes mean that you’ve gained favor with that character, while red notes mean that you’ve lost favor. Friendship values affect a variety of things, so respond how you would like, but just know that it’ll have consequences either way!

I’ll be writing out each dialogue option with the amount of points that you can gain or lose. If a dialogue branch doesn’t affect the friendship values of a character, I won’t be mentioning it.

**Friendship Value Choices**
  - I’m fine. (Mom +2)
  - … (Mom -1)

After talking to Mom you’re free to explore the S.S. Oceana. I highly recommend getting in the habit of talking to everyone and investigating places that seem to be of interest. You’ll gain lots of new information that way, as well as discovering new Pokémon and obtaining items.

For example, if you go downstairs to the room on the far left and up you’ll see a small crack on the wall where you’ll be able to overhear a conversation between a mysterious figure named Crescent and your mom. Heading into the room directly below that and interacting with a similar crack in the wall will allow you to overhear another conversation between a trio of suspicious figures.

Once you’re ready to proceed, head upstairs to the third level and talk to Captain Augustus. He’ll explain a few of Rejuvenation’s mechanics if you want. Head back downstairs and through the double doors to talk to Nancy and get the farewell banquet started.

Watch the cutscene, then follow the only available path through the ship until you’re whisked off it.

## OCEANA PIER
---
After you finish talking to Tesla, feel free to explore the pier, but you won’t be able to interact with much until you get your starter. Now’s a good time to look through your settings if you haven’t already. You can access  the photosensitivity/streamer mode here if you need it. 

If you’d like to get the world's quickest game over, head over to the yacht on the right side of the pier and talk to the guide. FREE TRIP! FREE TRIP! FREE TRIP!

Head north through the gate when you’re ready, time to get our first Pokémon!
