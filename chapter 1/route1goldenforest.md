## ROUTE 1
---

Enter the train station on the left side of East Gearaen. Tesla’s here to check on you! She’ll buy you a lifetime pass for this train and give you 3 *Potions*. You can go say hi to her at the hotel if you’d like, but it doesn’t give you any friendship. Talk to the old man in the top left corner and agree to help him before you get on the train.

New area, new Pokémon!

Talk to the old woman in front of the station and agree to help find her Furfrou.

Pick up the *Super Repel* just above then head to the left. There’s a **Whismur** that will battle you if you give it a Gourmet Treat and a *Potion* hidden in the pink and blue flowers below it. You can battle the Pidove flying over the bridge if you can catch up to it.

Pick up *TM60 - Quash* before heading through the gate.
