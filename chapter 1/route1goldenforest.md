## ROUTE 1
---

Enter the train station on the left side of East Gearen. Tesla’s here to check on you, but those friendship gain icons don't have actual points attached to them. She’ll buy you a lifetime pass for this train and give you 3 *Potions*, though! You can go say hi to her at the hotel if you’d like, but it doesn’t give you any friendship. Talk to the old man in the top left corner and agree to help him before you get on the train.

New area, new Pokémon!

Route 1 Grass

| GRASS: MORN    | %   | GRASS: DAY     | %   | GRASS: NIGHT    | %   |

Talk to the old woman in front of the station and agree to help find her Furfrou.

Pick up the *Super Repel* just above then head to the left. There’s a **Whismur** that will battle you if you give it a Gourmet Treat and a *Potion* hidden in the pink and blue flowers below it. You can battle the Pidove flying over the bridge if you can catch up to it.

Pick up *TM60 - Quash* before heading through the gate.

## GOLDENWOOD FOREST
---

Newer area, even newer Pokémon!

{: .text-blue-000}
Goldenwood Forest

| LAND         | %   | LAND      | %   | OLD ROD      | %   |
|:-------------|:----|:----------|:----|:-------------|:----|
| Sentret      | 24% | Deerling  | 20% | **Finneon**  | 100% |
| Poochyena    | 25% | Pidove    | 10% |     |  |
| **Spewpa**   | 19% | Pidgey    | 2%  |     |  |

Melia is going to join you throughout all our forest adventures, and she’ll heal your team after every fight. Unfortunately this means that the problem with catching Pokémon in the grass with Ren is the same here. You should do your best to catch everything anyway, because you won’t be able to come back to this area for a bit once you leave. Good luck!

You can battle the Sentrets in the overworld if you’d like.

Talk to the fisherman and accept his quest, then head up to the right between the trees to find the old lady’s Furfrou! Talk to it to send it back to her then return to the old lady. She’ll give you *5 Potions* and a *Great Ball* for your trouble! (+1 Karma)

Reenter the forest. Go up the stairs and pass the left bridge; you can battle the **Yanma** that are flying around! Now go down the stairs and go around until you reach the pile of Apricorns. You have to interact with it 3 times to get all the ones you need. 

Keep going south until you find that old man’s granddaughter. Talk to her to send her back to the station, we’ll get our reward later. Pick up the hidden *Rare Candy*, 2 tiles right and 1 tile down from the big rock.

Go back to the fisherman from the beginning and prepare for a really easy fight. You won’t be able to catch… Whatever this is. But the following cutscene is fun!

{: 	.text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**

 - You okay? (Melia +2)
 - That was close… (Neutral)

You’ll get *5 Exp. Candy S* and *5 Great Balls* for the trauma. (+1 Karma)

Head all the way north until you see the cave entrance, then take a left on the bridge. At the end of this path there’s a rock (just above a yellow flower) that has a hidden Potion. Enter the cave when you’re ready.

{: .text-blue-000}
## GOLDENWOOD CAVE
---

An even newer area and even newer Pokémon are here.

{: .text-blue-000}
Goldenwood Cave

| LAND       | %   | LAND        | %   | OLD ROD      | %   |
|:-----------|:----|:------------|:----|:-------------|:----|
| Noibat     | 34% | **Woobat**  | 17% | **Goldeen**  | 100% |
| Geodude    | 44% | Furret      | 4%  |     |  |

You can battle the Woobat flying around and the Psyduck that are staring blankly into space. Woobat is pretty good for the next gym!

Head all the way to the left. There’s a *Tiny Mushroom* hidden in the dark patch of soil near the patch of grass. Go up the bridge and grab the hidden *Potion* at the bottom of the tree.

Cross the bridge all the way to the right and talk to the white haired trainer. Melia won’t join you for this one.

{: .text-blue-000}
MarsBattle

You’ll get a *Star Shard* when you win and an **Aevian** Sewaddle with Baton Pass! For the first Aevian form we’ll find in this game, this one is pretty great with Intimidate as a hidden ability and good typing. 

Go back and head north on the bridge to learn more about Prism Pokémon! I already explained them when we met with Mr. Luck, but these specific Prism Pokémon are different to the ones that you find by chance in wild battles. For one, you can’t catch these (therefore you can’t take their Black Prisms away from them), and they’ll appear in the overworld with a rainbow silhouette. All of their stats get +2 so be prepared when you spot them.

{: 	.text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**

 - Did you get my good side? (Melia +2)
 - Don’t take pictures of me… (Melia -2)

Grab the *Great Ball* hidden in the grass sprouts to the left, the *Red Shard* right above the rock below it, and the *Tiny Mushroom* on the top right rock before following Melia into the ruins.

{: .warning }
> You will not be able to return to the Goldenwood area for a while, please make sure you catch all of the Pokémon you want as well as pick up all of the items.

You can interact with the murals on the wall to get some extra information. Follow Melia out the exit.

Welcome to the Silent Grove! You can follow Melia all the way up to the castle-like structure to talk to her. Watch a really lovely cutscene with some gorgeous art. Melia will challenge you to a battle, but before you do that check out her briefcase to find the passcode 3845 inputted. Keep that number in mind.

{: .text-blue-000}
MeliaBattle

![Melia1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344174707238502421/1344174816055525437/melia1.PNG?ex=67bff3d9&is=67bea259&hm=a5b58564959bec40cd7b3b9b34347e870f60d50e41e264c83d324a1eaff72cff&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

Melia doesn’t get a boost to basically anything on her team on this field, so this battle is pretty straightforward.

{: .text-blue-000}
## TEAM XEN AMBUSH
---

Follow Melia out of the Silent Grove, then out of the Goldenwood Cave. After the cutscene type in 3845 first to get an *Ability Capsule*, then 6489 to get yourself a free *Snag Machine* and *15 Poké Balls*!

Whenever you have your working Snag Machine, you’ll be able to catch Shadow Pokémon. This Snag Machine doesn’t work catching any other types of caught Pokémon though, so don’t even try! Catch the Grunt’s shadow Meowth and watch the cutscene.

If you talk to the grunt to the left you can catch a shadow Finneon. There’s a PC star to the right if you want to switch out your team for a future boss fight. Keep walking down the path.

{: 	.text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**

 - We have to. (Melia +2)
 - I’m not so sure myself… (Neutral)
 - With that attitude? Nope. (Melia -2)

Talk to the Grunt that’s harassing the lady near her garden to get the chance to catch a shadow **Cacnea**. 

Walk up towards the dried lake bed to get pulled into a double battle. If you need to heal, talk to Melia!

{: .text-blue-000}
EliAndSharonBattle

![EliAndSharon1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344174707238502421/1344174785101430795/elisharon1.PNG?ex=67bff3d2&is=67bea252&hm=8df6ef2dd598dd1d7fa42a83b374e5cdf9ff5ea50f691a8db67d3b03a5f73117&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

Another pretty straightforward double battle. Don’t let yourself get hit with too many debuff or status moves and you should be fine here, especially since you have Melia in your party! It’s also important to note that this isn’t really a true double battle, meaning you can’t focus on one side to make it a 2v1.

Walk forward and talk to the mysterious figure for another battle. This time you’re on your own.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZettaBattle

![Zetta1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344174707238502421/1344174818559397899/zetta1.PNG?ex=67bff3da&is=67bea25a&hm=1f55d995c2c18779b71b592fe7b981824651001bab2e5956f38296e0bff921e4&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

Good news! You can cut down his team right off the bat by catching **Snorunt**. Be careful of self destructing Minior’s and Zepto, Zetta’s ace who can cut you down if you’re unprepared. Try paralyzing it or grabbing a Pokémon with Intimidate (Qwilfish, Mightyena, etc.) to lower its attack.

Watch the cutscene and get devoured. Then walk left and up until you go into the forest. You can heal yourself with the faint green healing star right before you step on the bridge. Grab the strange looking Poké Ball to the left of it to update your CyberNav to get a new app called “Rift Dex” and receive the data for Code: Evo. Review the data, then walk forward when you’re ready for a fight.

{: .text-blue-000}
GyaradosBoss

![Gyarados1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344174707238502421/1344174785935966239/gyarados1.PNG?ex=67bff3d2&is=67bea252&hm=69a4253c853c35ddc4e15243c4b1ebe0e23c6c0a4a07ed4e2370d8c119858407&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

With field boosted Bite and Shadow Sneak (which also gets STAB), Rift Gyarados’ strength is nothing to sneeze at and can be considered a major hurdle for early game if you’re not prepared. Try paralyzing it if you can - Pikachu can come in clutch here if you've got it. Alolan Raticate can also put in work since it’ll deal massive damage with field boosted, super effective, STAB Crunch. It’ll boost its defenses when you break down its shield, so you might want to switch to special moves if you’ve got any as well. Good luck!

If you win you’ll get (+1 Karma), but it’s not necessary to progress if you’re having trouble.

Leave Route 1 with Melia, then talk to the old man at the Train Station to get your reward for finding his granddaughter: *4 Exp. Candy S*.

Exit the station and run all the way back to Gearen Lab to watch a cutscene in the room where you met Professor Jenner. Get ready for a fight!

{: .text-blue-000}
MadelisBattle

![Madelis1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344174707238502421/1344174786229698662/madelis1.PNG?ex=67bff3d2&is=67bea252&hm=9003b598c8fbbdc68f2daeaf162a3b25b0f3b68ab6e6056340b146f850092a73&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

You’ll be using Melia’s Togepi and Buneary here. It’s important to note that this seemingly impossible fight isn’t mandatory to win against, though if you do you’ll gain (Melia +1). If you want to try your luck I recommend Yawning with Hapi, switching to Buneary to take the Incinerate and then spamming Ancient Power when you switch Hapi back in. If you’re lucky you’ll get 3 sleep turns and an omni-boost to be able to tank an Incinerate. Hopefully at this point Houndoom’s health is low enough that when you sacrifice Hapi to revive Buneary, Buneary’s Fake Out defeats it.

Watch all the cutscenes and celebrate, we’re officially done with chapter one!
