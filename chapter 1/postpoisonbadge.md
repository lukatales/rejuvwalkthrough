## POST-GYM QUESTS
---

If you’ve been holding off on all the quests you’ve found around the city now’s a great time to do them! We’ll be doing a few minor things before we get into the heavy duty quests first. 

Go to Venam’s House and head upstairs to grab the *Poison Barb* sitting on her bed.

If you go back to Gearen Park you’ll be able to battle **Gossifleur** if you give it a Gourmet Treat!

Go back to the lab and talk to the lady in orange sitting in front of the computer. You’ll be able to participate in the Virtual League now that you have a badge and will give you a *Badge Card* to get you started. Talk to her to challenge the first gym leader, Falkner.

Falkner Battle

I always go with Cyndaquil as my starter which gives me an Onix. If you choose Totodile you’ll get a Phanpy, and if you go with Chikorita you’ll get a Mareep. All Pokémon are decently viable, with Chikorita’s pick being the hardest of the three, but you get coverage with Mareep in this first gym. The biggest thing to remember is that the Glitch Field reverts back to Gen 1 mechanics, yikes. Give yourself a refresh of old mechanics - or learn them for the first time - if you need to, as well as the other changes by checking the Field_Effect_Manuel in your Rejuvenation folder.

Once you win you’ll get a Virtual Badge. We’ll come back for the next one later!

The Poké Ball Boutique has updated its inventory.

Go to the Help Plaza to begin all of the quests around the city, accepting them from the bulletin board if you haven’t already. Talk to Ayuda in the top left corner to start the Zygarde quest! I’ll be showing the location of each cell in East Gearen after the Help Plaza quests but afterwards I’ll be covering them as they appear in the story.

## HQ 1: Save Starly!

Talk to the black haired girl in Gearen Lab next to Nurse Joy to get started, then make your way down to Oceana Pier. Go to the southwest dock to defeat a trainer and watch a lovely cutscene. Go back to the girl in the lab to finish the quest.

Go to Petal Salon in Right East Gearen and go upstairs to talk to Sasha. 

Head to the Aqua Building down the bridge to the south and talk to the girl on the second floor. Go back to Sasha at the Petal Salon.

Go to the Velvet Building in front of Gearen Lab and talk to the woman on the third floor, then go to the Emerald Building to the right of the Help Plaza. Talk to the red haired guy in the lobby, try to leave, then actually leave and go back to Sasha. Follow her down to Oceana Pier and defeat a Beauty and her Lvl. 19 Lopunny.

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $550 and a free haircut! (+1 Karma)

After this quest you’ll be able to get haircuts for your Pokémon for $1500 once a day. This’ll boost friendship!

### HQ 3: Hidden Library 1
---

Go to Gearen Lab and talk to the backpacker upstairs in the archives room. Talk to the mother directly south of the Help Plaza, the orange-haired girl named Karrina south of the entrance to the sewers, and the Chrisola Hotel receptionist.

Go back to the backpacker and tell him the library is intact, closed off, and about the Gearen tunnels.

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: *5 Great Balls* and *3 Timer Balls*. (+1 Karma)

{: .text-blue-000}
### HQ 5: Dangerous Pokémon
---

Prepare yourself for a battle and go to Oceana Pier. Take a left right when you come out of the gate to fight a pride of lions!

{: .text-blue-000}
Pyroar Boss Battle

A bit of a tough one, as Pyroar gets field boosted STAB Take Down that can sweep your team if you’re not careful. Try some attack lowering moves on it, or cut its speed down by paralyzing it, both can be done with a Pikachu’s Thunder Wave and Charm (obtainable in HQ 6) if you’re having trouble. Once you win you can get **Litleo** on your team.

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $350 and a *Nugget*. (+1 Karma)

### HQ 6: Battle Request
---

Let’s go to Chrisola Hotel and take the elevator up to the rooftop to battle that white haired trainer. Her name is Novae and she’s got a strong team!

{: .text-blue-000}
Novae Battle

This battle can be quite difficult if you’re not prepared. All normal type attacks are boosted on the city field, so even weak attacks like Passimian’s Tackle hit hard. Speaking of Passimian, it’s easily the strongest member on her team and will only get stronger if you try lowering its stats. Make sure you’ve got your own team of six and if you really need to, you can always return to this battle when you’ve raised the level cap with the next badge.

Win the fight to claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $350 and **Pichu**! (+1 Karma)

{: .text-blue-000}
### HQ 7: Wretched Music
---

You can only accept this quest at nighttime, but after you accept you can complete it at any time of day.

Prepare for a battle, talk to the Chrisola Hotel receptionist and go to the basement.

Rorim B. Battle

Watch out for those Teeter Dances!

**Friendship Value Choices**

 - You should stop. (Rorim B -2)
 - Yeah, he’s a jerk. (Rorim B +2)
 - The other guests….? (Rorim B +1)

Go back upstairs and talk to the bellboy that’s in the hallway to the left, and the girl in the blue dress in the top left room in the right hallway. Return to the basement.

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $1100 and, a *Gourmet Treat*, and *TM119 - Magical Leaf*! (+1 Karma)
