PSYCHE! TURN AROUND, WE GOT STUFF TO DO.

There’s a few new things that you can get in Goldenleaf Town now that you beat Narcissa. First off, go around town and talk to the locals who will give you a ton of stuff as an apology for treating you badly! You can get a *Full Heal*, *Revive*, *Super Potion*, and *3 Dusk Balls* this way.

If you go to the cemetery at night you can find a **Misdreavus** floating near the graves that will battle you if you give it a Gourmet Treat, and in the house at the bottom left of town you can enter and receive a **Snubbull** from the resident by interacting with it.

Cut the tree next to the theatre and enter a cave behind the waterfall. Step on the platform to open the 4-badge gate and grab the wisp before you head in. You’ll get a *Big Nugget* by interacting with the chest.

Go back to Wispy Path and head left until you reach a gate, it’s finally time to explore this area!

At the gate you’ll be asked to show off your strength.

CBattle

A strong trio of bugs! Aside from Galvantula you should be able to outspeed all of them though, just be careful of surprise attacks like Shadow Sneak. Nothing your team can’t handle, especially if you’re at the new level cap and bring some quality fire and rock types.

Goldenwood Forest Grass (Post Melia)

Go into the cave to grab a *Nugget* behind a smashable rock if you go left across the bridge and a *Rare Candy* and hidden *Blue Shard* around Challenger Mars. Exit the cave.

Exit the cave and cross the bridge to the left then head up the stairs to grab a hidden *Ether*. Head back down and down the stairs this time to grab a *Nest Ball* right below said stairs. Continue downwards, down more stairs and grab the hidden *Gourmet Treat* and cell.

ZCell 027: Goldenwood Forest

Cross the bridge to the right and go up a bit to get the hidden *Chesto Berry*, then go back down the stairs (off the rocky outcroppings) and curve upwards to grab the *Reverse Candy*, *Great Ball*, and *PP Up*.

Go down to where the ruined garden is to grab the *Guard Spec.* and hidden *Oran Berry*. Prepare yourself for a battle and head into the dried up lake bed.

GyaradosBoss

Remember how I said we’re going to hold off on exploring this area before Narcissa’s gym? This is why. Gyarados is back for revenge and has practically tripled the shield effects it used to have, and while its level is nothing out of the ordinary for this chapter, heck, Crobat was a higher level, I do think this fight is more difficult considering there's less broader counters for its power. I tried my best to set up as well as I could in the first two shield breaks, then Intimidated it on the last shield to be able to survive and sweep. If you’re feeling patient you can also rely on misses, since Thunder Fang and Dragon Rush don’t have 100% accuracy. And I know I say this every time, but unless you want to try and avoid Waterfall flinches I’d paralyze it, unless you have a few Pokémon that are faster. Remember to read up on the fields!

If you’re struggling and want to try a cheeky strategy, you can put a non-normal type Pokémon in your first slot to bait Shadow Forces, then switch in a normal Pokémon with a stat boosting move like Hone Claws and use it. Shadow Force will fail and give you a clean set up turn, which will then allow you to do some serious damage. I personally used Obstagoon for this! You’re also welcome to use this to switch in normal type Pokémon with Intimidate to lower Gyarados’ stats, but it's not as reliable because of how it clears stat drops after the second shield break.

Speaking of, you should now expect almost every upcoming boss fight to clear its stat drops at least once at some point within the battle. It might still be useful to give yourself time to set up with a boss throwing out weak moves, but, especially if you’ve lowered its speed, you might be shocked when the boss comes back with a vengeance and knocks out your carefully buffed Pokémon.

You’ll receive (+1 Karma) when you win and Agent C will give you a bug mystery egg that contains either Sizzlipede, Joltik, or Blipbug with special egg moves! Remember that you can’t soft reset for a different species, as mystery eggs are determined when you make your save.

Grab the hidden *Persim Berry* nearby before you go and let's head into Wispy Ruins, shall we?
