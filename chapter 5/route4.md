## POST-GHOST ERRANDS

PSYCHE! TURN AROUND, WE GOT STUFF TO DO.

There’s a few new things that you can get in Goldenleaf Town now that you beat Narcissa. First off, go around town and talk to the locals who will give you a ton of stuff as an apology for treating you badly! You can get a *Full Heal*, *Revive*, *Super Potion*, and *3 Dusk Balls* this way.

If you go to the cemetery at night you can find a **Misdreavus** floating near the graves that will battle you if you give it a Gourmet Treat, and in the house at the bottom left of town you can enter and receive a **Snubbull** from the resident by interacting with it.

Cut the tree next to the theatre and enter a cave behind the waterfall. Step on the platform to open the 4-badge gate and grab the wisp before you head in. You’ll get a *Big Nugget* by interacting with the chest.

Go back to Wispy Path and head left until you reach a gate, it’s finally time to explore this area!

At the gate you’ll be asked to show off your strength.

{: .text-blue-000}
CBattle

A strong trio of bugs! Aside from Galvantula you should be able to outspeed all of them though, just be careful of surprise attacks like Shadow Sneak. Nothing your team can’t handle, especially if you’re at the new level cap and bring some quality fire and rock types.

Go into the cave to grab a *Nugget* behind a smashable rock if you go left across the bridge and a *Rare Candy* and hidden *Blue Shard* around Challenger Mars. Exit the cave.

Exit the cave and cross the bridge to the left then head up the stairs to grab a hidden *Ether*. Head back down and down the stairs this time to grab a *Nest Ball* right below said stairs. Continue downwards, down more stairs and grab the hidden *Gourmet Treat* and cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 027: Goldenwood Forest

Cross the bridge to the right and go up a bit to get the hidden *Chesto Berry*, then go back down the stairs (off the rocky outcroppings) and curve upwards to grab the *Reverse Candy*, *Great Ball*, and *PP Up*.

Go down to where the ruined garden is to grab the *Guard Spec.* and hidden *Oran Berry*. Prepare yourself for a battle and head into the dried up lake bed.

GyaradosBoss

Remember how I said we’re going to hold off on exploring this area before Narcissa’s gym? This is why. Gyarados is back for revenge and has practically tripled the shield effects it used to have, and while its level is nothing out of the ordinary for this chapter, heck, Crobat was a higher level, I do think this fight is more difficult considering there's less broader counters for its power. I tried my best to set up as well as I could in the first two shield breaks, then Intimidated it on the last shield to be able to survive and sweep. If you’re feeling patient you can also rely on misses, since Thunder Fang and Dragon Rush don’t have 100% accuracy. And I know I say this every time, but unless you want to try and avoid Waterfall flinches I’d paralyze it, unless you have a few Pokémon that are faster. Remember to read up on the fields!

If you’re struggling and want to try a cheeky strategy, you can put a non-normal type Pokémon in your first slot to bait Shadow Forces, then switch in a normal Pokémon with a stat boosting move like Hone Claws and use it. Shadow Force will fail and give you a clean set up turn, which will then allow you to do some serious damage. I personally used Obstagoon for this! You’re also welcome to use this to switch in normal type Pokémon with Intimidate to lower Gyarados’ stats, but it's not as reliable because of how it clears stat drops after the second shield break.

Speaking of, you should now expect almost every upcoming boss fight to clear its stat drops at least once at some point within the battle. It might still be useful to give yourself time to set up with a boss throwing out weak moves, but, especially if you’ve lowered its speed, you might be shocked when the boss comes back with a vengeance and knocks out your carefully buffed Pokémon.

You’ll receive (+1 Karma) when you win and Agent C will give you a bug mystery egg that contains either Sizzlipede, Joltik, or Blipbug with special egg moves! Remember that you can’t soft reset for a different species, as mystery eggs are determined when you make your save.

Grab the hidden *Persim Berry* nearby before you go and let's head into Wispy Ruins, shall we?

Some new spooky Pokémon here.

| **Alolan Graveler**  | %   | Natu          | %   | **Xatu**             | %   |

Follow the path until you see the Scrafty and Banette, then keep going right to grab the wisp. Go back and head up, you’re gonna be dropped by a couple of Shuppets, but that’s okay!

{: .text-blue-000}
Wispy Chasm

| LAND                 | %   | LAND                | %   | LAND         | %   |

| Galarian Linoone     | 2%  |               |   |   |   |

Head to the right then all the way up until you hit a 3-way fork. Go right, up,grab the *Cleanse Tag* in the outcropping, then go left, down, right, and up to trap the Shuppet and send it someplace else. Our goal to get out of here is to find four of these Shuppets to lift a gate.

Go back to where you started and head left this time. Keep going left and up until you land on a larger island, then go down. Hop across the slab at the bottom to bait the Shuppet into going right and trapping it.

Return to the large island and go up this time. Head left when you can and lead the Shuppet into the long vertical piece (above the *Max Repel* you can grab) to trap it by hopping around.

Go down and interact with the **Phantump** to battle it. Make sure to catch a female Phantump to breed it for a later quest. Grab the hidden *Yellow Shard* on this island and go all the way back up.

Keep heading up, then left, then up when you see another Phantump. Here’s another one of those badge doors that will give you a *Dawn Stone* when you interact with the chest.

Go back down until you reach the large island shaped like an “O” and has two ledges. Go right then up, passing the punk. Grab the *Calcium* on your left, then continue going up. Head left again then up, and lead the Shuppet around until it gets trapped. You’ll have to go around the large island to make sure it goes the right way.

Now that the gate is open we can go up and enter another 1-badge gate and grab the *Dusk Stone* inside the chest. Go up the ladder and grab the cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 028: Wispy Chasm

Go up and follow the path until you hit a hiker. Go right, then up and prepare for a battle.

PokeGangBattle

A lot of these Pokémon aren’t fully evolved, but remember that the field still boosts a lot of ghost type moves. If you’re worried about one side more than the other you can focus on them to make it a 2v1.

Exit the ruins.

## ROUTE 4
---

There’s a lot of new stuff here! Route 4 is huge so I’ll be covering it in sections as we pass them. For one, there’s items everywhere, indicated by the sparkles in the overworld. These sparkly items change every day, so I can’t give you a comprehensive list without taking up several pages of space, but you can expect things like berries, Poké Balls, herb items, and other miscellaneous items like mushrooms and honey.

We’re gonna head up the stairs first and take a left. Occasionally, there will be a ranger that gives you *2 Blue Shards* if you talk to him. Make sure to grab the cell at nighttime!

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 029: Route 4 (Night)

Take the stairs up toward Adventurer’s Cliff and grab *TM100 - Confide*. Go left. If it's night you can battle a Misdreavus here but more importantly there’s a hidden *Leaf Stone* in the flowers.

Head all the way back down toward the entrance, and this time keep going down and follow the path. Say hi time Nim for me and don’t forget to grab the cell when you go up!

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 030: Route 4

Nim is gonna join you as we explore the rest of the route!

You can battle the **Flabébe**, **Emolga**, Hoothoot and Pidove (if it's day) around here. Catch an Emolga for later!

Go left and talk to Beth, we need to find a guy to fix the landslide problem. Head all the way right until you reach a new section! This is Route 4 (East). 

This place has the same encounters as the one we were just in, but you can battle the Cubone that appear during the day around here.

Keep going right and interact with the strange hole in the ground from the bottom. Watch the cutscene and learn about Rift Dens, Cairo will also give you *5 Rift Fragments*. You can encounter some cool Shadow Pokémon and you can catch them after knocking down the shields. If you refuse to fight or defeat a them gives *250 Red Essence* for common (red) and *500 Red Essence* for rare (blue). Catching the Pokémon will give 500 and 1000 respectively.

**Friendship Value Choices**
 - You okay, Nim? (Aelita +1)
 - You’re acting weird… (Neutral)

The grass encounters here are exactly the same, but there’s **Wooloo** during the day and Duskull at night that you can battle when you head North. There’s also another rift den if you cross the bridge to the right.

Scents are used to help you open the hearts of Shadow Pokémon to purify them, the more expensive the more effective. Crests are held items that are given to specific Pokémon that can change abilities, boost stats, or give other effects to buff Pokémon. They’re a very fun mechanic in Rejuvenation that should be taken advantage of if you have a Pokémon on your team that has a crest. 

If you have exactly 10,000 Red Essence in your inventory, you can talk to the **Chespin** in Cairo’s house and he’ll give it to you. Check the Gather Cube in your Key Items pocket to check how much you have.

Make sure to buy a Bike Voucher before entering Akuwa Town!

When you exit Cairo’s house, keep going right and underneath the bridge to grab *TM45 - Attract*.

Prepare for a battle and try to enter Akuwa Town up north.

{: .text-blue-000}
NimBattle

Nim’s team is always quite tough, especially since it thrives on the psychic terrain that she sets up. Don’t underestimate her Pokémon, even if they are slow, since they’re bulky and will hit back twice as hard if you don’t knock them out. Take out Stonjourner first since it’s going to be boosting the strength of any Pokémon next to it, and Darmanitan is going to be in Zen Mode the entire time because of this field. If you’re having trouble I recommend picking any Pokémon after Stonjourner is gone and lowering its Attack or Sp. Attack, that way you can focus on one Pokémon without worrying about the other picking your Pokémon off while they’re weak. I wouldn’t recommend bug types for her team since so many of them have coverage and high defenses to make you regret your choice. Watch out for the Lunatone and Solrock wombo combo too, since Lunatone can flinch you with Rock Slide and Solrock has a tendency to explode if you don’t knock it out fast enough.

Right now, Nim’s team still isn’t at it’s full potential so you should be able to use some dark or ghost types to deal with it. I mean, can you imagine this with Trick Room? You got this!

## AKUWA TOWN?
---

Follow Aelita into Akuwa Town. Grab the hidden *Super Repel* right at the entrance and find a hurt old man! Head inside the Pokémon Center to grab the *Defibrillator*. Use it on the old man and get yelled at, but don’t follow Aelita just yet!

Go to the right of town. There’s a cell that appears at nighttime next to Truck Guy, and you can enter the building above to find another cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 031: Akuwa Town (Night)

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 032: Akuwa Town

Go down below where the old man was. There’s a **Ducklett** Egg there that you can pick up and hatch, and another cell at nighttime.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 033: Akuwa Town (Night)

Let’s follow Aelita to the beach. You can battle the **Clauncher** running around the sand. Don’t forget to pick up *TM135 - Brine* and the hidden Soda Pop in the rock. Grab the cell just outside the ACDMC.

ZCell 034: Akuwa Town

DO NOT FOLLOW AELITA INTO THE GYM. We have a few more things to do before we continue story, and going through the next cutscenes will cut us off from Floria Island for a while.

{: .text-blue-000}
## PRE-AQUARIUM ERRANDS
---

Go back to Goldenleaf and take the truck back to East Gearen with your Drifloon in tow. Go to the library. Talk to the blue-haired girl at the front for a fun cutscene that will become relevant later, then go upstairs. Show Zumi the Drifloon to get *3 Exp. Candy M*. She doesn’t have another Pokémon for us right now so we’ll come back later. Pay to enter the library proper and go to the room on the left to talk to the little girl. She’ll give you a quiz so you have to answer brown, Goldenwood Forest, Goldenleaf Area. Get them all right and she’ll give you a *Thunderstone*!

Go to the Help Plaza next door and talk to Ayuda to get a *Cell Imprint* for finding 25 cells. He’ll want 35 for the next reward.

Go to the AP Center in the hotel and buy the Golden Surfboard and the Golden Claws if you haven’t already. If you can’t afford both, focus on the surfboard. There’s also some new TMs here, *TM56 - Fling* and *TM47 - Low Sweep*.

Get that Slugma you caught in Caratos and the Emolga you caught in Route 4. Now that the level cap was raised you can evolve it into a Magcargo at Lvl. 38 and give it to the painter on Route 2. He’ll give you a *Charcoal* for it and ask for an Emolga, which you already have! He’ll give you a *Magnet* for it and *TM96 - Nature Power* for completing the quest.

{: .text-blue-000}
## Mystery Egg
---

Take the truck to Sheridan and put the female Phantump and a compatible Pokémon from the Grass or Amorphous egg groups in the daycare (Oddish, Paras, Bellsprout, Sunkern, etc.). Get the Phantump egg and go to Route 3 and talk to the boy with the orange hat in front of a stall. He wants to trade it for the egg he just got. You’ll receive 1 of 21 options of Pokémon. Once again, you cannot reset for the species since that’s determined when you first start the game.

| ROUTE 3 MYSTERY EGG                                  |

Go back to Route 4, we’re almost done! Don’t enter the Akuwa gate, instead take a left and go north between a broken chain link fence.

## Lost Camp
---

Watch the cutscene and meet Maman! A lovely woman for sure. She wants us to find some lost children and send them here so they have a place to stay. Maman says that there’s 11 lost children we need to find. Some of these aren’t available yet since we need Surf and Rock Climb, but we’re going to go ahead and get the ones we can now for some neat rewards.

During the day you can ask her for hints on where to find these lost children, but don’t worry, I got them all on a list for you right here if you want:
 1. Marissa: Wispy path, where you found Espurr
 2. Matthew: At the bottom of Route 3 being terrorized by adorable Bidoof
 3. Cybur: In the little fair area, next to where you got your mystery egg
 4. James: In the Spring of Purification on the right side
 5. Andrew: In the Abandoned Sewers through the entrance near Venam’s Gym
 6. Jessibelle: Right of the Akuwa Town Gym

Go back to the Lost Camp once you find these 6 kids. Talk to Maman during the day and she will ask you to donate $5000, then after following her into the new house talk to her again and donate $7000. After you’ve donated twice you can find **Eevee** running around the front garden, and the Eevee will keep coming back too. Endless Eevees!

A few of these kids have little stores too!

Those are all the kids we can get right now. Go back to Akuwa Town.

{: .warning }
> This is your last chance to do anything on Floria Island. We will not be coming back for a long time, so make sure that you have any items, Pokémon, and that you've done the quests you want to do. The Rift Gyarados boss will be locked out once you talk to Aelita. I would also recommend making sure you have a ghost Pokémon that has/can learn Curse in your PC box.

Return to the aquarium and walk all the way to the back and left. Talk to Aelita.

Oh, and don’t worry about winning or not in the next battle. It won’t matter.
