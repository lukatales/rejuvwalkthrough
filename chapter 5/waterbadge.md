## THE DEWDROP BADGE
---

Talk to the other characters if you’d like  then talk to Valarie at the dock up at the top so she can take you to where you’ll have your battle.

Braixen will provide you advice and information about Valarie. Stand opposite of Val once you’re ready, she’ll ask if you wanna bet on your success, but you can do whatever you’re comfortable with as it won’t affect anything – except your wallet!

It’s been said often that you either think Valarie is a joke or one of the bigger walls of the game. The Water Surface Field is an absolute boon to water types to no one’s surprise, so you really should read up on all the effects it has in the manual. It’s very unlikely you’re going to outspeed any of Valarie’s team because of it so you need to be prepared to be hit hard by water attacks. For a couple of her Pokémon you can try using their secondary types to do damage like Qwilfish, Primarina, Dewgong. Speaking of, try getting rid of Dewgong as fast as possible to prevent it from stalling you completely.

Primarina’s bulk is most likely going to prevent you from OHKOing and Sparkling Aria hits like a truck. You can get around this by using a Pokémon with Soundproof like Exploud or Electrode and doing damage/debuffing it for another Pokémon to take down if necessary. If you want to travel a little, go to Deep Terajuma South and grab yourself a Lotad. Ludicolo reaps the same benefits of the field just like any other water type and has Swift Swim with the added benefit of knowing super effective grass moves. Cacturne or Maractus are also popular choices with Water Absorb. You might also be tempted to run a sun team, in which case I believe Sunkern and Leafeon are a few that can learn Sunny Day through level up.

A couple of other options are setting up Tailwind for your own team to have a better chance at outspeeding her, using Intimidate or Obstruct on her physical attackers, or straight up just changing the field if you have Blizzard or through 2 uses of Sludge Wave. Valarie can be difficult, but I believe in you, trainer!

You’ll get the Dewdrop Badge once you win, but the party’s only just started!
