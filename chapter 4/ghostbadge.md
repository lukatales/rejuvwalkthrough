## THE PHANTASM BADGE
---

When we exit the center we’ll finally have access to an Audino breeder nearby! She’s next to the Poké Mart and hands out *3 Exp Candy M*.

Let’s go to Narcissa’s gym.

 - This will work. (Ren +2)
 - I’m unsure… (Ren +1)
 - It’s a stupid idea. (Ren -2)

Head through the door on the left, it’s time for a gym puzzle! And also some Pokémon.

| LAND      | %   | LAND         | %   | LAND         | %   |
|:----------|:----|:-------------|:----|:-------------|:----|
| Rattata   | 32% | Raticate     | 12% | **Duskull**  | 10% |
| Shuppet   | 14% | **Banette**  | 9%  | **Yamask**   |  |

The whole point of the puzzle is that you want to pass by/enter doors that have the torch lit next to them. If you don’t, the theatre will send you all the way back to the beginning. 

Go through the door on the left. Talk to Mimikyu. Interact with the sign. Exit. Enter the room on the right. Pass by the torch on the bottom wall. Pass by the torch on the top wall. Exit the room. Enter the room on the left. Go through the passageway. Go upstairs. Exit the door south of you. Head down the stairs and enter the room on the right. Pass through the torch on the bottom wall. Walk by the mirror on the top wall and get pulled in. Pass by the torch on your right. Try to exit through the door below you but get teleported. Enter the top left room. Pass by the torch on the bottom wall. Exit through the door on the right. Go down and enter the door next to the plant. Go through the mirror directly above you.

Phew, hopefully you got through that alright. There’s a recovery star and a PC star here for you so you can get ready before you enter the next room.

Ren’s still got a few Pokémon that aren’t fully evolved so overall it should be too difficult of a fight. You might be surprised because of Corvisquire’s unexpected bulk with its Eviolite, but you shouldn’t have to worry about its moves, especially if you have a rock or steel type Pokémon. Frogadier hasn’t reached its full potential either, so an electric type can do work there. Arcanine is going to be the hardest of its Pokémon to defeat, but it doesn’t have Extreme Speed, so you should be able to out speed it with some priority moves of your own to finish it off.

Once you win, head through the mirror. Before challenging Narcissa, pick up the *Super Potion*, *Rawst Berry*, and *Rare Candy* in the audience space.

NarcissaBattle

Let it be known that the first time I fought Narcissa in v13.5 I was terrified of her Magical Seed, Unburden Drifblim and almost cried tears of joy when I realized it didn’t exist anymore. Narcy got a couple of nerfs in this update, changing her Chandelure to a Lampet being another one of them, but you should still be incredibly wary of her strength. Haunted Field doesn’t mess around when it comes to buffing ghost types, and even though you can nullify the field with Flash or Dazzling Scream, 4/6 Pokémon on her team can immediately turn it back to Haunted Field with Spectral Scream. Remember that ghost moves are super effective against normal types here!

I’m gonna have to recommend dark types again, since most of Narcy’s Pokémon don’t have coverage for them outside of Drifblim and Mimikyu. Be wary of Dusclops, since it has the bulk to finish off a weakened team if you let it, and don’t forget that Mismagius is a grass type! Poisoning or burning Dusclops is a valid strategy, and I noticed that you can bait some switches if you send out a steel type against Mimikyu. Narcissa’s hard, but there’s a few weaknesses of hers that you can exploit. 

When you win you’ll get the *Phantasm Badge* and *TM30 - Shadow Ball*. Congratulations! Enjoy some cutscenes, some more optimistic than others, then enter Wispy Ruins to continue the story.
