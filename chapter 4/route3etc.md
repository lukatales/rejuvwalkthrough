## PRE-TRAVEL ERRANDS
---

Let’s start at East Gearen, we have a lot of errands to do before we go to Route 3.

At the Gearen Lab, talk to the girl with the orange hat to continue our quest to beat the virtual league.

{: .text-blue-000}
BugsyBattle

Quilava and Onix make this gym very easy with a few Flame Wheels and Rock Tombs. If you chose Croconaw you’ll get Growlithe, and if you chose Bayleef you’ll get Gastly. If you’re lucky, Croconow will get some flinches with Ice Fang unti lit faints, and Growlithe should make short work of the rest of Bugsy’s team. Flaaffy on Bayleef’s team should pull their weight since ⅔ Pokémon are weak to electric moves. You’ll get a second *Virtual Badge* once you win.

Head to the library and cut down the tree next to the building. At the very top of this area, there’s a *Synthetic Seed* in the top right white flower patch, a *Blue Shard* 3 tiles down and 1 right from the the sign, a *Grass Gem* in the tile in front of the bottom dumpster, and an *Escape Rope* 3 tiles down from the purple flower on the top dirt patch on the “roof” of the building.

While we’re here, go to the AP Center in the hotel and get Flash if you haven’t already, as well as the Golden Lantern,  Golden Surfboard, and Golden Claws if you can afford them, ordered in their priority.

We got some new things to buy!

{: .text-blue-000}
Pokéball Boutique

| ITEM           | PRICE  |
|:---------------|:-------|
| *Nest Ball*    | $1000  |
| *Net Ball*     | $1000  |

{: .text-blue-000}
Berry Emporium

| ITEM           | PRICE  |
|:---------------|:-------|
| *Rawst Berry*  | $300   |
| *Chesto Berry* | $300   |
| *Aspear Berry* | $300   |

Let’s go to Route 1. We can’t do much here except cut the trees on the left side. You can catch the Sentret, Pidove, and **Teddiursa** that are walking around. At the end of the path there’s a group of Loudred and a lvl. 50 Rainbow Exploud. Avoid the line of sight on the Exploud or it will attack you and force all of the Loudred to attack you in tandem. You can battle the **Loudred** separately without triggering the Exploud, and grab *TM78 - Bulldoze*, *TM122 - Screech*, a *Jolly Mint*, and a cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 013: Route 1

If you can’t manage to avoid its line of sight, then you can always come back for this later.

Take the train to Route 2 and walk to the Painter’s RV and cut the trees behind his house to grab a cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 014: Route 2

Enter Amethyst Cave and go up the bridge and to the left where you can smash some rocks. Go through the doorway and cut down the tree in front of the building.

{: .text-blue-000}
River's End (RV)

| LAND                   | %   | LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   |
|:-----------------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|
| **Oricorio (Pom Pom)** | 57% | **Yungoos**   | 10% | **Cutiefly**  | 14% |
| **Dustox**             | 10% | Butterfree    | 9%  |    |  |

Make your way to Sheridan. Find the battle girl at the south of it with a Throw and Sawk next to her and talk to her. You’ll have to battle her and her 6 Pokémon to get a chance at battling the **Throh**. If you want Sawk,  you’ll have to trade that Throw away and you won’t get it back, so I recommend waiting until we can get a Ditto, as Throhs can only be male.

Enter the house on the right, next to the old man. Say hi to Gothitelle!

{: .text-blue-000}
GothitelleBoss

Gothitelle isn’t fast by any means, so take advantage of that by lowering her defenses in the first stage. I would also recommend bringing a few dark types if you’re having trouble, since she gets walled by them pretty hard. Overall, this battle with her is straightforward and you get a Gothita when you win!

Go near the store and pick up *TM54 - False Swipe*, and the cell behind the tree.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 015: Sheridan

If you happen to catch Beth on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Sunday morning before you go, she has new drinks available.

{: .text-blue-000}
Sheridan Drinks Shop

| ITEM           | PRICE  |
|:---------------|:-------|
| *Berry Juice*  | $200   |
| *Lemonade*     | $350   |
| *Moomoo Milk*  | $1500  |

Pop by East Gearen real fast and go to the Help Plaza. Ayuda has another reward for 15 cells: a *Cell Imprint*.

And that’s it! We’re all done with our post badge errands, time to go to Route 3! … Except not really, in order to keep this guide as streamlined as possible we’re going to take a direct left when we enter Route 3 to immediately go up into Mirage Woods. Trust me, this’ll keep everything organized!

{: .text-blue-000}
## MIRAGE FOREST
---

Hopefully Aelita won’t be too mad for making her wait… Anyway, new Pokémon!

{: .text-blue-000}
Mirage Woods

| LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   | OLD ROD       | %    |
|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:-----|
| Spritzee      | 32% | **Doduo**     | 9%  | Wooper        | 100% |
| **Kecleon**   | 32% | **Zangoose**  | 2%  |    |  |
| **Stantler**  | 25% |     |   |    |  |

Trees, rocks, bushes, and all sorts of things will appear and disappear in these woods, all you have to do is touch them to show off the illusion. Go straight up until a tree disappears in your path to see what to look for.

There’s a *Bug Gem* in the rock above. Go left and up, passing through a tree. Don’t go up through the circus tent, instead keep going left through a narrow path. You can’t get to the berries just yet, but if you go down, there’s a hidden *Hyper Potion* 2 tiles left and 1 tile up from a bush. Keep going down and right to grab an *Exp. Candy L* in a bush.

Go back up through the circus tent then continue going left. There’s a hidden *Moomoo Milk* 2 tiles down and 3 to the right of the pink and white flowers next to the patch of grass. There’s a *Pretty Wing* above those very same flowers. Traverse the patch of grass and cut down the tree to get baited, but continue forward until a cave appears. Grab *TM48 - Round*. There’s a *Magical Seed* 2 tiles down from the middle rock.

Exit the cave to the right of the bush that’s above the white and pink flowers  hidden cuttable tree that you can cut through. Walk up into the rocky outcropping. Above the large rock on this outcropping you can reveal another set of stairs if you walk left. There’s an *Ether* 3 tiles down and 1 tile right of the hiker.

Talk to the hiker to start a quest, then go back and go down the right stairs this time. There’s a hidden *Exp. Candy M* 2 tiles down and 5 tiles right of the aroma lady. You can also grab an *Ultra Ball* if you squeeze past some trees right above it.

Go left, there’s a hidden *Super Repel* in the far left pink and white flower tile, and a hidden *Poison Gem* in the top pink and white flower tile. Go back down and pass through some trees to get around the big rock formation. There’s a *Rawst Berry* south of it on the left pink and white flower tile.

The bridge is going to disappear but not to worry, go down and through the cuttable tree. All the way down, above the pink and white flowers, there’s a hidden *Steam Ball*. Go back up and cross the real bridge on the right this time. 

Keep going up, there’s a hidden *X Defend* 3 tiles down and 1 tile right of the signpost and a *Reverse Candy* in the top pink and white flower tile. 


{: .text-blue-000}
### Mirage Town
---

To the right of the house with the red roof there’s a hidden *Genius Wing* above the stools. Enter the house with the red roof to grab a *Steam Ball* and get a quest from the scientist. There’s also a PC and a recovery machine here for you if you need it.

Exit the house and go up. There’s a hidden *Clever Wing* in the pink and white flowers up top. 

Go up the stairs on the right and enter the house there. There’s an *Itemfinder* waiting for us on the table, happy days! Now that we have this, I’m still going to list all the hidden items in the area, but I won’t need to be as specific with them. Remember to register the itemfinder to your ‘S’ key!

Don’t cut the tree yet, instead go behind the waterfall to the next part of town. Grab the *Carbos* in the right house and talk to the grandma in the left house. She’ll tell us that to ring the bell we should check Phasial Cave for the missing part.

You can make some stairs appear if you go down and to the left a little. There’s a *Rare Candy* in the bush.

Go back to the other side of town and cut the tree and make stairs appear. There’s a *Reverse Candy* that you can get before entering the cave.

Grab the *Everstone* hidden in the right rock and go down the ladder. There’s *2 Exp. Candy M* in the left rock. Go through the entrance and get the *Repel* in the rock next to the vine before heading down and grabbing the hidden *Nugget* near the stairs. Head down the ladder.

Grab *TM66 - Payback*, and the hidden *Yellow Shard* and Red Shard. Keep following the path, finding the hidden *Rock Gem* along the way, but don’t face the hole yet. There’s an *Awakening* in the right rock. Save and prepare for a battle, you remembered to get Flash right?

{: .text-blue-000}
CrobatBoss

MAN, WHAT A BAT. This thing is a beast and unfortunately uses flying type moves that aren’t weakened in the Cave Field. I’d paralyze right off the start if you can, maybe do some Intimidate spam if you’re able, or straight up use moves like Charm or Screech. Don’t forget that they’re null and void after the second shield break though, or you’ll be in for a world of trouble. As for recommendations, Pikachu was very useful for me here, and rock type moves/rock type Pokémon are heavily boosted on this field. Steel types wall this thing too, if you’ve got them. 

Personally, I didn’t bother going after the SOS Pokémon unless it was coincidental. Zubat’s Confuse Ray is annoying but Woobat can boost Crobat’s moves and flinch you with Air Slash, while Noibat makes you easy pickings with Super fang.

There’s no shame in coming back for this one with a higher level cap. You get a **Zubat** when you win!

Go back to the scientist to close off the quest. Leave the town and cross the bridge. Go left and down a little and you’ll find a tree that will disappear and lead you straight back to the entrance of the woods! That shortcut stays forever once it’s activated.

## ROUTE 3
---

We’re going to go through Route 3, then go around and go through Phasial Cave. Sound good? Good. 

{: .text-blue-000}
Route 3 (North)

| LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   | OLD ROD       | %    |
|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:-----|
| Fetchinder    | 32% | Doduo         | 9%  | Wooper        | 100% |
| **Yamper**    | 30% | **Boltund**   | 2%  |    |  |
| **Herdier**   | 25% | Zangoose      | 2%  |    |  |

If you manage to interact with the **Surskit** on the water you can battle them!

There’s a hidden *Honey* near the bridge, a *Quiet Mint* next to the RV, and a cell below it.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 016: Route 3

Enter the RV and talk to the guy next to the GameCube, we’ve got a Virtual League battle to get through!

{: .text-blue-000}
WhitneyBattle

Quilava and Onix make pretty good work of Whitney’s team, especially if you manage to get off a burn with Fire Punch. Use Onix for Miltank to resist some Rollouts and slowly lower its HP with Rock Tomb. With Totodile’s team, I think you should be able to get through most of the team with Croconaw and lowering Miltank’s speed with Phanpy’s Bulldoze to finish it off. If you can lock Miltank into Rollout before switching into Phanpy that will also help. For Bayleef’s team, Gastly is gonna be immune to most of their moves, save Thunder Punch and Rollout, so you could use that to your advantage.

When you win you’ll get another *Virtual Badge*, but we’re not done! Talk to the guy again for another battle.

{: .text-blue-000}
MortyBattle

This battle really upped the difficulty, especially if you get frozen twice in a row like I did! Eventually I was able to clean up with Quilava and Qwilfish, but be careful of Ice Punches being thrown at your Onix. ¾ Pokémon are immune to ground, so Donphan can’t do much on Croconaw’s team, but luckily Croconaw, Growlithe, and Eevee all have Bite. If you’re in a pinch with Gengar, Donphan can live through one non-crit hit of Ice Punch so you can use Bulldoze. Bayleef’s team might also run into some issues, but Haunter’s Sucker Punch should put in a little bit of work if you set up screens with Bayleef.

One more *Virtual Badge* down, but that’s all we can do for now. The other lady in the RV is the Move Deleter should you need her services.

Exit the RV and go down the stairs below it. Grab the *Sitrus Berry* behind the cuttable tree and the *Yellow Shard* below the cave entrance. Head back up and go down the other set of stairs.

Talk to Aelita. If it’s daytime she’ll ask if she can get something to eat!

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - I’m starving. (Aelita +2, after she buys you an ice cream)
 - No distractions! (Neutral)

Here’s a hidden *Green Shard* near the ice cream stand. Go to the left and down through the cuttable tree for a cell. Grab *TM117 - Payday* while you're here and the *Star Piece* behind that.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 017: Route 3

There’s a couple of shops around here:

{: .text-blue-000}

| *Strawberry Ice Cream* | $800   |

Buy 10 Sweet Hearts for a quest much later.

Go all the way down and turn left. There’s a hidden *Sassy Mint* in the larger patch of grass and you can battle the Combees flying around if you want. Head right and up from the purple tent to grab the hidden *Blue Shard* and the cell.

ZCell 018: Route 3

There’s a hidden *Rare Candy* below the RV and you can get a *Rose Tea* from the Hiker inside. Exit and go all the way down where the leaves start to change and grab the *Super Repel* nearby the border.

{: .text-blue-000}
Route 3 (South)

| LAND          | %   | LAND          | %   | OLD ROD       | %    |
|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:-----|
| Fetchinder    | 32% | Doduo         | 7%  | Wooper        | 100% |
| **Nickit**    | 30% | **Thievul**   | 4%  |    |  |
| Herdier       | 25% | Zangoose      | 2%  |    |  |

You’re gonna start being chased by Bidoofs around here, they’re pretty cute though!

There’s a hidden *Red Shard* and *Super Potion* on the way down. Go up the stairs and grab the *Mystic Water* next to the waterfall, then go back all the way down and grab a *Honey* when you cross the lower bridge. 

Don’t talk to Aelita just yet and walk all the way back up to top of Route 3 and enter the cave through the entrance that’s surrounded by water.

{: .text-blue-000}
## PHASIAL CAVE

Hopefully you have Flash!

{: .text-blue-000}
Route 3 (South)

| LAND               | %   | LAND          | %   | OLD ROD       | %    |
|:-------------------|:----|:--------------|:----|:--------------|:-----|
| **Galarian Meowth  | 20% | **Chewtle**   | 25%  | Wooper        | 100% |
| Wooper             | 32% | **Bibarel**   | 9%  |    |  |
| **Silicobra**      | 12% | **Venipede**  | 2%  |    |  |

There’s a *Rock Gem* on one of the rocks up top, a *Magical Seed* farther left, and an *Ability Capsule* below that. Go down and right, there’s *Steel Gem* on one of the rocks in the right outcropping.

Go down past the Lass and grab the hidden *Reverse Candy* and the cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 019: Phasial Cave

Go left and down past the lost black belt to grab another cell and head up and left to get a hidden Mineral Ball. Go down and head right to grab a new cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 020: Phasial Cave

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 021: Phasial Cave

Go up and grab the hidden *Green Shard* on one of the rock piles, then keep going right and grab the *Bell Machine*! There’s also a *Blue Shard* nearby, a *Sun Stone* further down, and a *Red Shard* further down than that. That’s all we can do in Phasial Cave for now, so go left and exit up the ladder.

Let’s go back to Mirage Town before we finally talk to Aelita. Talk to the grandma in the house next to the bell and she’ll fix the bell so you can ring it. Ring the bell and then you have to go all the way back to where the RV that the Hiker has now left unattended. Touch the RV to make it disappear and grab the Telluric Seed before heading in. Approach the Zorua once you’re ready for a fight. You’ll have to face off against a Lvl. 46 Zoroark, but it’s not a Ruthless Pokémon so the fight itself shouldn’t be too difficult if you have some bulky Pokémon. The Zoroark will allow you to add the **Zorua** to your team! It can come with 3 different 2 set of moves that you can reset for:
 - Memento and Defect
 - Extrasensory and Counter
 - Copycat and Sucker Punch.

The next gym is a ghost one, so this should be a good addition to your team especially if you exploit the Illusion ability to its fullest. Grab the *Black Glasses* and the hidden *Yellow Shard*, *Exp Candy Ms*, and *Moomoo Milk* before you head all the way back to Aelita to talk to her.

Interact with the door on the purple tent. It’s Ren!

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - A Gym Battle! (Ren +1)
 - Wanna see the sights~ (Ren +1)
 - No reason… (Ren -2)

Watch the following cutscene and get ready for a battle.

{: .text-blue-000}
AelitaBattle

Aelita doesn’t get as many moves boosted by the field as Keta so she’s already a little easier that way. Watch out for Hawlucha, because it's very likely that anything you send out will faint from a Flying Gem boosted Acrobatics. Combusken can be a bit of a threat too, but overall this is just a preview to what Aelita’s team will become later.

Once you win, go back and talk to Aelita to open the gate and watch the cutscene.
