{: 	.text-blue-000}
##### Mega Stone, Z-Crystal, and Crest Count

None available

{: 	.text-blue-000}
##### Pokémon Count

This includes all of the newly caught Pokémon, not Pokémon that could have been evolved from them or, in future chapters, from previously obtained Pokémon. Meaning, if you evolved your Fletchling into a Fletchinder the Fletchinder will not appear on this list, as it is not available to be caught.

These Pokémon are roughly in appearance order.

 - Alolan Meowth
 - Hoppip
 - Skiploom
 - Plusle
 - Minun
 - Girafarig
 - Porygon
