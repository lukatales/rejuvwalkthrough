## JUNCTION BRIDGE
---

Accept Karrina’s fast travel to Junction Bridge and head inside the lab for a battle.

{: .text-blue-000}
JenkelBattle

You get to choose between Ren or Venam in this fight as your partner in this fight, and both are solid allies to have. Musharna does have a considerate amount of bulk, but as long as you don’t let it get too many boosts with Charge Beam you should be fine.

You get *TM94 - Rock Smash* for your troubles and there’s *6 Cell Batteries* found back inside the factory, three of which we’ll need for a quest later on, so save them!

Go south and use Rock Smash, then go right and use it again. You can battle **Blitzle** if you give it a Gourmet Treat.

When you go back to East Gearen, there’s going to be Team Xen grunts running around waiting to battle you. They’re easily avoidable, but you can get extra experience and money – as well as some shadow Pokémon! The grunt next to the Route 1 train station has a shadow **Vanillite**. 

Walk right until you see the Emerald Building, the grunt next to it has a shadow Pidove and a shadow **Wooper**. Battle the grunt about him to get a shadow **Bonsly**. 

Continue right toward the Route 2 train station. Pick up the Golden Hammer and Golden Axe in the Chrisola Casino if you haven’t already before you get on.

In the next route there’s going to be a couple of trees you can Headbutt. The Litleo we got from HQ: 5 knows it, so take it with you if you want to take advantage of that. Go to the Route 2 train station and buy yourself a ticket to board.

## ROUTE 2

There’s a *Carbos* down and to the right of the purple flower near the station.

Catch a Cherubi and make sure to keep it in your party for a quest later, and a Dedenne for Zumi. We also need an Aipom for later but there’s an easier spot to catch it in this route if you don’t have Headbutt.

There’s a *Green Shard* in the green bush right of the Aroma Lady, a *Red Shard* in the pink bush, and a *Repel* past the pink flower to her left all the way down behind the pink tree.

Go up the stairs and talk to the man in front of the RV. He’ll want you to bring him a Cherrim for a quest. Level up the Cherubi you just caught to Lvl. 25 to evolve it into Cherrim and show it to him to get a Miracle Seed. The next Pokémon he’ll want us to bring is a Magcargo, so let’s keep that in mind.

Above the artist there’s a hidden *Friend Ball* below the dark pink flower tile.

Go back down and through the cave entrance.

ZCell 005: Gemstream Mine (Night)

Exit and watch a cloaked figure walk away from you. There’s a hidden *Relaxed Mint* on a right purple flower up from the bridge. There’s also a *Rose Incense* on the second level in the topmost light pink flower on the right.

ZCell 006: Route 2

Talk to the reporter during the day to engage in a battle, then continue going right and enter the mine again. Go all the way down and exit, then go left past the waterfalls. There’s a mystery egg here that can contain Skiddo, Mudbray, or Galarian Ponyta with a random move. You can’t reset the Pokémon as that’s decided when you first make your save, but you can soft reset for shininess, IVs, ability, and the egg move.

Route 2 Mystery Egg

| Pidgey        | 10% | Klink         | 4% |    |  |

There’s a hidden *Ability Capsule* in the rock behind the egg.

Go back up through the cave, then take the entrance to the right of the ladder. Go down, 4 tiles to the right of the dark pink flower there’s a hidden *Blue Shard*. Keep going down and find yourself a hidden *Level Ball* tucked away to the right of the bottommost stairs.

ZCell 007: Route 2

To the left there’s a hidden *Lemonade* one tile left and up from the cell. Enter the building above.

This is the Kecleon Bazaar! The items on the left are chosen at random every day from the table below, but to the right you can buy the ever trusty *Magnetic Lure* for $2000. If you equip the lure to the first Pokémon in your party you will only get wild encounters that you haven’t caught yet. It’s a fantastic tool to catch rare Pokémon and fill out your Pokédex.

| *Poké Ball*    | $200   | *Poké Ball*    | $200   |

Exit the bazaar when you’re ready and head left. Catch one of the Aipoms walking around for a trade later. There’s a hidden *Exp. Candy S* on a grassy tile 5 tiles to the right and 2 tiles up from the cell.

ZCell 008: Route 2

There’s a hidden *Ether* in the wall 6 tiles above the primadonna. 

Go all the way back to the entrance of the cave, then head north. There’s a healing star there for you if you need to heal your party and 2 tiles right and 1 tile up of it there’s a hidden *Gourmet Treat*. Enter the cave when you’re ready.

## AMETHYST CAVE (FIRST VISIT

Watch the cutscene. There’s some new Pokémon here!

| Pidgey        | 10% | Klink         | 4% |    |  |

We’ll come back to this cave soon enough for all the goodies, so for now just go right and down the stairs.

Go and talk to Ren.

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - Is that strange? (Ren +1)
 - What about them? (Neutral)

Go down, there’s a hidden *Potion* in the tall rock right below where Ren was, and an *Antidote* below the wooden crate. Keep going down and cross the bridge after a short cutscene. There’s a *Green Shard* in the right cluster of crates, a *Resist Wing* in the rock below the mining rock, and a *Blue Shard* 1 tile left and 3 tiles down from that rock. Continue down the stairs.

The butterflies near the entrance can heal your party once. Grab the *Blue Shard* and the *Revive* that’s 5 tiles left of the butterflies. On the left bridge there’s a hidden *Fire Gem* 2 tiles right and 2 tiles up from the computer, and a *Modest Mint* you can pick up.

Give the **Lunatone** a Gourmet Treat to battle it and activate the panel for a quest later. When you’re ready, go all the way up to watch a cutscene.

Pick up the data for Code: Materna and read through it before going north.

You’ll get to pick between Venam and Ren for this fight. I recommend Venam because her team has a lot more field boosted moves, plus she clears up the Toxic Spikes that get set up later for you.

{: .text-blue-000}
GalvantulaBoss

Here’s where you’re going to start to see those shield break effects really add up. Galvantula is going to do its best to lower your speed and poison you to do massive damage, and its Joltiks will keep coming around to ruin your day. Luckily it doesn’t have any field boosted moves, so you can try to take advantage of that. If you have a steel type you should be set with its resistances, or you can use its quad weakness to ground moves to your advantage.

Watch the following sad cutscenes until you find yourself at the docks on Oceana Pier.

**Friendship Value Choices**
 - You think I can do it? (Neutral)
 - Where do I go next? (Ren +2)

## WRAPPING UP IN EAST GEAREN

We have a lot of new things to do before we go to Sheridan Village, so lets ge them out of the way.
