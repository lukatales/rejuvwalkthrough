You get to choose between Ren or Venam in this fight as your partner in this fight, and both are solid allies to have. Musharna does have a considerate amount of bulk, but as long as you don’t let it get too many boosts with Charge Beam you should be fine.

You get *TM94 - Rock Smash* for your troubles and there’s *6 Cell Batteries* found back inside the factory, three of which we’ll need for a quest later on, so save them!

Go south and use Rock Smash, then go right and use it again. You can battle **Blitzle** if you give it a Gourmet Treat.

When you go back to East Gearen, there’s going to be Team Xen grunts running around waiting to battle you. They’re easily avoidable, but you can get extra experience and money – as well as some shadow Pokémon! The grunt next to the Route 1 train station has a shadow **Vanillite**. 

Walk right until you see the Emerald Building, the grunt next to it has a shadow Pidove and a shadow **Wooper**. Battle the grunt about him to get a shadow **Bonsly**. 

Continue right toward the Route 2 train station. Pick up the Golden Hammer and Golden Axe in the Chrisola Casino if you haven’t already before you get on.

In the next route there’s going to be a couple of trees you can Headbutt. The Litleo we got from HQ: 5 knows it, so take it with you if you want to take advantage of that. Go to the Route 2 train station and buy yourself a ticket to board.

## ROUTE 2

There’s a *Carbos* down and to the right of the purple flower near the station.

| **Beedrill**    | 1%  |    |   |       |   |

Catch a Cherubi and make sure to keep it in your party for a quest later, and a Dedenne for Zumi. We also need an Aipom for later but there’s an easier spot to catch it in this route if you don’t have Headbutt.

There’s a *Green Shard* in the green bush right of the Aroma Lady, a *Red Shard* in the pink bush, and a *Repel* past the pink flower to her left all the way down behind the pink tree.

Go up the stairs and talk to the man in front of the RV. He’ll want you to bring him a Cherrim for a quest. Level up the Cherubi you just caught to Lvl. 25 to evolve it into Cherrim and show it to him to get a Miracle Seed. The next Pokémon he’ll want us to bring is a Magcargo, so let’s keep that in mind.

Above the artist there’s a hidden *Friend Ball* below the dark pink flower tile.

Go back down and through the cave entrance.

Exit and watch a cloaked figure walk away from you. There’s a hidden *Relaxed Mint* on a right purple flower up from the bridge. There’s also a *Rose Incense* on the second level in the topmost light pink flower on the right.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 006: Route 2

Talk to the reporter during the day to engage in a battle, then continue going right and enter the mine again. Go all the way down and exit, then go left past the waterfalls. There’s a mystery egg here that can contain Skiddo, Mudbray, or Galarian Ponyta with a random move. You can’t reset the Pokémon as that’s decided when you first make your save, but you can soft reset for shininess, IVs, ability, and the egg move.

There’s a hidden *Ability Capsule* in the rock behind the egg.

Go back up through the cave, then take the entrance to the right of the ladder. Go down, 4 tiles to the right of the dark pink flower there’s a hidden *Blue Shard*. Keep going down and find yourself a hidden *Level Ball* tucked away to the right of the bottommost stairs.

To the left there’s a hidden *Lemonade* one tile left and up from the cell. Enter the building above.

This is the Kecleon Bazaar! The items on the left are chosen at random every day from the table below, but to the right you can buy the ever trusty *Magnetic Lure* for $2000. If you equip the lure to the first Pokémon in your party you will only get wild encounters that you haven’t caught yet. It’s a fantastic tool to catch rare Pokémon and fill out your Pokédex.

Exit the bazaar when you’re ready and head left. Catch one of the Aipoms walking around for a trade later. There’s a hidden *Exp. Candy S* on a grassy tile 5 tiles to the right and 2 tiles up from the cell.

There’s a hidden *Ether* in the wall 6 tiles above the primadonna. 

Go all the way back to the entrance of the cave, then head north. There’s a healing star there for you if you need to heal your party and 2 tiles right and 1 tile up of it there’s a hidden *Gourmet Treat*. Enter the cave when you’re ready.

| **Sandshrew** | 15% |      |   |      |   |

We’ll come back to this cave soon enough for all the goodies, so for now just go right and down the stairs.

Go and talk to Ren.

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - Is that strange? (Ren +1)
 - What about them? (Neutral)

Go down, there’s a hidden *Potion* in the tall rock right below where Ren was, and an *Antidote* below the wooden crate. Keep going down and cross the bridge after a short cutscene. There’s a *Green Shard* in the right cluster of crates, a *Resist Wing* in the rock below the mining rock, and a *Blue Shard* 1 tile left and 3 tiles down from that rock. Continue down the stairs.

The butterflies near the entrance can heal your party once. Grab the *Blue Shard* and the *Revive* that’s 5 tiles left of the butterflies. On the left bridge there’s a hidden *Fire Gem* 2 tiles right and 2 tiles up from the computer, and a *Modest Mint* you can pick up.

Give the **Lunatone** a Gourmet Treat to battle it and activate the panel for a quest later. When you’re ready, go all the way up to watch a cutscene.

Pick up the data for Code: Materna and read through it before going north.

You’ll get to pick between Venam and Ren for this fight. I recommend Venam because her team has a lot more field boosted moves, plus she clears up the Toxic Spikes that get set up later for you.

{: .text-blue-000}
GalvantulaBoss

![Galvantula1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344174707238502421/1344182024608677920/galvantula1.PNG?ex=67bffa90&is=67bea910&hm=758a7dd6638d121a984327560f82d31742ef6616e4f648a6c907a33ba2f71a7e&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

Here’s where you’re going to start to see those shield break effects really add up. Galvantula is going to do its best to lower your speed and poison you to do massive damage, and its Joltiks will keep coming around to ruin your day. Luckily it doesn’t have any field boosted moves, so you can try to take advantage of that. If you have a steel type you should be set with its resistances, or you can use its quad weakness to ground moves to your advantage.

Watch the following sad cutscenes until you find yourself at the docks on Oceana Pier.

## WRAPPING UP IN EAST GEAREN
---

We have a lot of new things to do before we go to Sheridan Village, so lets ge them out of the way.

Reenter East Gearen and head left and up until you see the purple striped building. Go down the alleyway on the right and pick up the hidden *Burn Heal* in the box before entering the sewers. You can pick up a *Rare Candy* next to the cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 009: Abandoned Sewers (West Entrance)

![Cell9](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344183747406200883/1344183802452512778/5.PNG?ex=67bffc38&is=67beaab8&hm=102a75e11ceef8068dd1d28c076e98546feba963272712687527b52a0be77453&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

There’s a hidden *Reverse Candy* on the right wall of the stairs when you enter. Go through the gates to watch a peculiar cutscene.

You can battle a **Munna** if you give it a Gourmet Treat. There’s a hidden *Super Potion* in the top right corner next to the dumpster, a hidden *Green Shard* above the rightmost Munna, a **Red Shard** 3 tiles left and 1 tile up from the leftmost Munna, and a *Super Repel* 2 tiles down and 1 tile left from that.

Go to the left to get yourself a *Telluric Seed* at the bottom of the docks, right below the line of dumpsters, and a cell.

{: .text-blue-000}
ZCell 010: Gearen Alleyway (Sewer Entrance)

![Cell10](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344183747406200883/1344183802691457134/6.PNG?ex=67bffc38&is=67beaab8&hm=30209370dcc8fc2630e9e3992987311b9e5e9e60cc6aae6f6490027317d06eef&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

Leave and go to the Help Plaza. Go to the back to talk to Ayuda since you have more than 5 cells. He’ll give you *TM49 - Echoed Voice*. Speak to him again and he’ll give you a *Cell Imprint* for having 10 cells. We'll come back when we have more later.

Go next door to the library and show off Dedenne to Zumi, who in return will give us the *Advanced Pokédex*. This will show a lot more details about the Pokémon you catch like their learnsets, possible egg and TM moves, stats and a whole bunch of other information. Our next mission is to catch a Drifloon, but that’s a while off so don’t worry.

Go to Chrisola Hotel and in a room on the right hallway there’s a woman with a **Shinx**. Talk to her and she’ll give it to you!

Enter the right room on the top section where the lady and her Mincinno is where she’ll ask you to chase after it. Go to the lobby to talk to it, then the left hallway and around until it gets taken by a couple of grunts. Follow them to Gearen Park and battle them until they let it go. Follow it back to the room where it was originally where the old lady will let you battle the **Minccino**.

South of the sewer entrance you can enter Karrina’s hideout. Go down the elevator to talk to her and she’ll ask for your help to fight off a rival gang in Amethyst Cave.

{: .text-blue-000}
## AMETHYST CAVE (SECOND VISIT)
---

Take the train back to Route 2 and enter Amethyst Cave once more.

Down 2 tiles and 1 tile to the left of the girl next to the rock to grab a hidden *Nugget*. Head left, here’s a hidden *Green Shard* 4 tiles down from the lone train track. Grab the *Quiet Mint* and the hidden *Mineral Ball* in the right corner of the minecart. 

In the room where you got sucked in through a portal to fight Galvantula there’s hidden *Electric Gem* in the top left minecart. Return to the entrance of the cave.

Go up the bridge. There’s a *Red Shard* below the smashable rock at the end of it, and a *Super Potion* to the right of the smashable rock along the right wall. Above that, there’s a *Mineral Ball* in the center of the top minecart if you interact with it from the top, and a *Green Shard* 1 tile up and 6 tiles to the left of that.

Walk left. There’s a hidden *Zinc* behind the smashable rock below the drill, embedded in the wall, and in that same drill there’s another *Mineral Ball*. Go to the left to find a *Reverse Candy* to the left of the second drill, then smash the rocks and go through the exit.

We can’t do much here until we get cut, but you can grab the *Blue Shard* in the purple flower below the large black one, and a *Green Shard* in the pink flower 2 tiles to the right of the cuttable tree.

Go back through the exit and climb up the stairs. You’ll have to talk to the weird cloaked figure to get through, but after that you can pick up the *Electric Gem* in the rock right next to him.

Don’t go through the gate yet and keep going left. You’ll have to battle the Biker to complete Karrina’s gang quest, but it’s a pretty easy fight. You’ll get **Houndour** for your efforts! Go through the north gate once you’re ready.

There’s a *Genius Wing* directly to the right once you enter the new area and a *Reverse Candy* 3 tiles left and 2 tiles down from the smashable rock. Go all the way around and exit to the next area.

Grab the *Repel* in the wooden crate to the right, then go down the stairs and around to the right to grab the Rock Gem in the tall rock before heading through another gate.

When you’re ready for a battle, go north and get selected to play the fun games! Pick any of the smashable rocks to make a purple pebble, then pick the rightmost tree since it looks a little suspicious.

Get ready for a battle with Nim!

This double battle is fairly simple. Lunatone and Solrock can be an issue with their Rock Slides, but if you have a faster, hard hitting Pokémon you should be all set! Also, don’t be me and constantly forget that Psychic Terrain blocks priority moves.

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - Yes (Nim +2)
 - No (Nim - 2)

Watch an endearing cutscene to get yourself a *Room ID Card*, we’ll figure out where that goes later. Grab the *Super Potion* 2 tiles left and 2 tiles up from the sign, and the *Reverse Candy* up the stairs to the right in a wall before exiting the cave.
