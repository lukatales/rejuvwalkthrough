If you haven’t caught one already, Spearow evolves at Lvl. 20 and can be useful for the next gym.

Let’s get some errands out of the way before we continue the story.

Enter the Move Tutor’s house to start the quest to look for her, then exit and cross the bridge up and to the left. Go down, there’s a *Tiny Mushroom* next to the tile with the blue and white flowers. Enter the building and talk to the clerk. She’ll be upset, but eventually gives you a free *Super Potion*! Exit and go up to grab the cell here.

If you enter the building through the correct doorway there’s a new shop. You have access to Great Balls and Super Potions now!

Next to the cell you can find Truck Guy! He’ll take you back to East Gearen for free. We'll make use of this service a lot later, don't worry!

Keep going all the way to the right to enter the inn. There’s a hidden *Ability Capsule* in the blue and white flower tile just outside, and inside the Aroma Lady will give you a *Sweet Heart*. Right now you’ll have to pay $450 to heal your Pokémon, but if you can hold off for a bit it’ll become free with story progression. 

Head north and take a left. There’s an Audino breeder here that will give you *3 Exp. Candy S* every time you win. 

The building next door is the Daycare where you can leave your Pokémon if you’d like. For now, take the female Jigglypuff you caught and any Pokémon in the Fairy Egg group (Pikachu, Pachirisu, Cherubi, Skitty, etc.) to get an Igglybuff to trade with someone at the Inn. In return you’ll get a **Smoochum** holding a *Twisted Spoon*!

Go north until you enter Sheridan Arena.

You can battle the **Swablu** flying overhead. Knock on the door and when you get no response, go back to the Cherry Blossom Inn to watch another cutscene. Follow Aelita upstairs to her room.

**Friendship Value Choices**
 - I will. (Aelita +3)
 - Why me?? (Aelita -1)

The inn is now free for us to use! Take a snooze to progress the story and head outside, then go all the way back up to Sensei’s house and talk to Aelita.

### Amethyst Grotto
---

Go back to the cave but this time go all the way back to the Route 2 entrance. Take a left until you see a rock with a pink stone on it then interact with it. Go all the way down to the grotto.
