## PRE-GYM SIDEQUESTS
---

First off, ask Truck Guy to take you back to East Gearen. Head to to the lab. Enter Professor Jenner’s room, then go up and to the right and enter the room on the right with the ID Key. There’s an *Exp. Share* you can grab here, and some fun notes to read below it. After reading, grab the *Audition Tape* and stick it in the computer to watch a wholesome cutscene. Go back to Sheridan when you’re ready. 

Go to the inn and enter the first room on the left to trigger a sidequest where we’ll have to go save a girl’s boyfriend. Go to Amethyst Cave and go down from the place where you met Nim, then go left. There’s going to be a box of herbs next to the river. Interact with it and follow the voices in the next room, then interact with the **Solrock**. You’ll have to catch it to succeed, since defeating it in battle is not enough. Once you catch it, go back to the Cherry Blossom Inn to get yourself a sweet reward of $8000! 

Accept all of the quests at the Help Plaza.
