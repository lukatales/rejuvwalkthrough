## PRE-GYM SIDEQUESTS
---

First off, ask Truck Guy to take you back to East Gearen. Head to to the lab. Enter Professor Jenner’s room, then go up and to the right and enter the room on the right with the ID Key. There’s an *Exp. Share* you can grab here, and some fun notes to read below it. After reading, grab the *Audition Tape* and stick it in the computer to watch a wholesome cutscene. Go back to Sheridan when you’re ready. 

Go to the inn and enter the first room on the left to trigger a sidequest where we’ll have to go save a girl’s boyfriend. Go to Amethyst Cave and go down from the place where you met Nim, then go left. There’s going to be a box of herbs next to the river. Interact with it and follow the voices in the next room, then interact with the **Solrock**. You’ll have to catch it to succeed, since defeating it in battle is not enough. Once you catch it, go back to the Cherry Blossom Inn to get yourself a sweet reward of $8000! 

Accept all of the quests at the Help Plaza.

### HQ 8: Hidden Library 2
---

Right outside the help center there’s a backpacker waiting for you to talk to him. He’ll tell you to investigate three different places so let’s take the truck to East Gearen.

Go to Chrisola Hotel and talk to Karen.

{: .text-blue-000}
**Friendship Value Choices**
 - The Hidden Library. (Karen +2)
 - Looking for a BATHROOM. (Neutral)

Go to Dr. Jenkel’s factory next and watch the cutscene, then go to Gearen Park and talk to Karen. Head inside the library. The only Pokémon you can encounter here is Unown.

Let’s go to the right before we follow Karen. Go up and climb on the bookshelves to grab *TM63 - Embargo*. Keep going up and left to grab the cell.

ZCell 012: Hidden Library

Climb back down and keep going right. You’ll want to collect the 9 multicolored books around this room and deliver them to the empty bookshelf at the top right. If you do, **Elgyem** will battle you!

Go back to the center room and then go down to grab *TM19 - Secret Power*. Go back to the center and head up. There’s a hidden *Ether* 2 tiles below the candles next to the door Karen went through, grab it and enter.

Watch the cutscene. No Mega Ring for you, but at least you’ll get the *Ancient Book*. (Karen +2)

Take the truck back to Sheridan. The Backpacker will want to take the book off you and if you accept he’ll give you a *Blue Moon Ice Cream*, a rare healing item, but you’ll lose the ability to translate Garufan texts… There is one solution, and that is to buy another translation book at the Kecleon Bazaar for $75,000. The choice is up to you! But if you do decide to give it away you really should try to buy it again before long.

Either way, go claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $950 and a *Water Stone*. (+1 Karma)

### HQ 9: Stolen Cargo
---

Back to East Gearen, go down to Oceana Pier and go south east. Talk to the blond guy and follow him into the warehouse.

Don’t go on the arrows since they’ll hurt your Pokémon. Talk to the Biker on the left to battle him. You want to end the battle with the Factory Field “turned off.” Once the tiles are turned off head up the middle section of arrows and prepare for a fight. Venam will join you, so you should be okay.

Beat the thugs and get some advice from Venam. (Venam +1)

Head down the left arrows and activate the panel, then go right to grab *TM09 - Venoshock*.

Go back to Sheridan and claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $950 and *5 Gourmet Treats*. (+1 Karma)

### HQ 10: Trade Me!/Bounty!
---

Take that Aipom you caught on Route 2 then go up to Sheridan Arena. Talk to the girl with blue hair on the bridge to trade your Aipom for her **Pancham**.

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $1920 and a *Rare Candy*! (+1 Karma)

### HQ 11: Fetch an Item!
---

Go to the Kecleon Bazaar on Route 2 to watch an execution. You have two options here, buy the item for $50,000, or steal it. If you steal it, you can buy your innocence for $20,000 or accept your fate and be taken to the dungeon.

If you choose to pay, go back to the Help Plaza and give it to the black belt in front of the building. If not, break yourself out of prison and head right. Look at the map on the wall and follow the route listed on it.

Go to the center or right room, the left room, then the left room again to get either a *Dusk Stone*, *Dawn Stone*, or *Ice Stone* depending on your save and head up to exit the dungeon.

Hope that the Xen analyst grunt is still alive and head back to the Help Plaza in Sheridan to give the black belt standing in front  the item. He’ll give you a *Blue Moon Ice Cream* for your valor if you stole the item.

Claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $1890 and a *Casteliacone*! (+1 Karma)

### HQ 11: Fetch an Item!
---

This quest is only available at night time. Novae is waiting outside of the Cherry Blossom Inn. Talk to her and watch the cutscene.

NovaeAndRorimBBattle

![NovaeAndRorimB](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1344174707238502421/1344187730942361631/novaeandrorimb1.PNG?ex=67bfffe0&is=67beae60&hm=e81dd27f98b511dcce569ebe5d4e5f62b7b86e9e6fec4395705e95e1b2fc7c99&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)  

Our first proper double battle! Rorim B’s Mr. Mime is going to want to slowly whittle you down with Icy Winds and lower your speed. I recommend focusing on his team first, so that you can face Novae’s team 2v1 and you won’t have to worry about her Pokémon hitting insanely hard on top of Rorim whittling you down. You can try using the field to your advantage too.

You’re more than welcome to save this battle for later if you’re having trouble.

Finish watching the cutscene and claim your reward at the Help Plaza: $1600 and **Clobbopus**. (+1 Karma)

That's all for quests! Time to get our next badge.
