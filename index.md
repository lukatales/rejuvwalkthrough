# Welcome to the guide

This guide was inspired by and references BIGJRA’s v13 guide (with permission), and its creation would not have been possible without it. While BigJRA has completed the v13.5 guide, I found it worthwhile to complete my own version that I started prior. The goal of this guide will be to provide a story walkthrough for both routes; Pokémon and hidden item locations; team descriptions, advice, and strategies; and more. Please remember to update your game before you play by hitting the “update” application in your Rejuvenation folder. 

{: .warning }
> This guide contains major spoilers, though I've done my best to keep my descriptions as vague as possible.

## Before getting started

There will be moments where this guide will push backtracking with HMs further back in order to provide the most efficient experience. This means that it's possible to obtain certain items and Pokémon earlier than listed, but this is the cost of reducing the monumental amount of backtracking Rejuvenation asks for. For those that want to explore as soon as possible, I’ll be providing the names of the sections you can jump to when the HM becomes available.

**Bolded** Pokémon mean that’s the first time you’ve been able to encounter the Pokémon, but does not include the rest of their evolution lines even if they are technically available. For example, if you can catch a Sentret in one area and you could evolve it into a Furret for your Pokédex, Furret will still be bolded when we find it first in another area. Starters or mystery egg Pokémon will not be bolded; instead, they will be bolded when they’re first available for anybody to capture them to account for those looking to have a living Pokédex.

If you are planning a Renegade playthrough, please read the Renegade section at the bottom of the guide (placed there to avoid spoilers). Renegade route demands that you either skip certain quests, or make specific choices that are good to know going in. I would not recommend the Renegade route for your first playthrough.
