# Welcome to the guide
---

This guide was inspired by and references BIGJRA’s v13 guide (with permission), and its creation would not have been possible without it. While BigJRA has completed the v13.5 guide, I found it worthwhile to complete my own version that I started prior. The goal of this guide will be to provide a story walkthrough for both routes; Pokémon and hidden item locations; team descriptions, advice, and strategies; and more. Please remember to update your game before you play by hitting the “update” application in your Rejuvenation folder.

> This guide contains major spoilers, though I've done my best to keep my descriptions as vague as possible.

## Before getting started

There will be moments where this guide will push backtracking with HMs further back in order to provide the most efficient experience. This means that it's possible to obtain certain items and Pokémon earlier than listed, but this is the cost of reducing the monumental amount of backtracking Rejuvenation asks for. For those that want to explore as soon as possible, I’ll be providing the names of the sections you can jump to when the HM becomes available.

**Bolded** Pokémon mean that’s the first time you’ve been able to encounter the Pokémon, but does not include the rest of their evolution lines even if they are technically available. For example, if you can catch a Sentret in one area and you could evolve it into a Furret for your Pokédex, Furret will still be bolded when we find it first in another area. Starters or mystery egg Pokémon will not be bolded; instead, they will be bolded when they’re first available for anybody to capture them to account for those looking to have a living Pokédex.

If you are planning a Renegade playthrough, please read the Renegade section at the bottom of the guide. Renegade route demands that you either skip certain quests, or make specific choices that are good to know going in. I would not recommend the Renegade route for your first playthrough. 

On the sidebar you'll find all of the chapters, mechanics, Pokédex information, etc., which then split off into smaller pages underneath its parent. The main pages of each chapter will describe the amount of Z-Cells and list all of the Pokémon that you should have caught if you're looking to build a living Pokédex. If you are looking for a specific item, Pokémon, moment, you can use the search function at the top of the page to help you locate it. 

It you're looking for a trainer battle, you can search for it for by typing "NameBattle", or "NameandNameBattle" for double battles, at the top search bar. Boss fights will all be labeled with "NameBoss", the name being the Pokémon of the fight. It will then take you to the section where the fight takes place, where you'll have to scroll down to find the battle.
